    if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full). &#10;   &#10; (2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans &#10;     from our sponsors of up to an aggregate of $300,000 as described in this &#10;     prospectus. As of February 28, 2019, we had not borrowed any amounts (of up &#10;     to $300,000 available to us) under the promissory notes with our sponsors to &#10;     be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These amounts will &#10;     be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the offering proceeds that &#10;     has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than &#10;     underwriting commissions). In the event that offering expenses are more than &#10;     as set forth in this table, they will be repaid using a portion of the &#10;     $1,500,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust account and set aside &#10;     for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that offering &#10;     expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be &#10;     used for post-closing working capital expenses. &#10;   &#10; (3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% &#10;     of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial &#10;     business combination, $8,750,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s &#10;     deferred commissions (or $10,062,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment &#10;     option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds &#10;     held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to &#10;     the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be &#10;     used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or &#10;     businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general &#10;     corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on &#10;     indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, &#10;     to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The &#10;     underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred &#10;     underwriting discounts and commissions. &#10;   &#10; (4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be &#10;     available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or &#10;     all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For &#10;     example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current &#10;     estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial &#10;     business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business &#10;     combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target &#10;     in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur &#10;     additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement &#10;     of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a &#10;     result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and &#10;     financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use &#10;     of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of &#10;     allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current &#10;     estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for &#10;     our expenses. &#10;   &#10; (5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our &#10;     initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment &#10;     fees for financing. &#10;   &#10; Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement &#10; warrants, $250,000,000 (or $287,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment &#10; option is exercised in full), including $8,750,000 (or $10,062,500 if the &#10; underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred &#10; underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States &#10; at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company &#10; acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills &#10; with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain &#10; conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only &#10; in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest &#10; earned on the trust account will be approximately $5,650,000 per year, assuming &#10; an interest rate of 2.26% per year; however, we can provide no assurance &#10; regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held &#10; in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations, the &#10; proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will &#10; not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (a) the &#10; completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public &#10; shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our &#10; third amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance &#10; or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not &#10; complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of &#10; this offering or to provide for redemption in connection with a business &#10; combination, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to &#10; complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of &#10; this offering, subject to applicable law. &#10;  &#10; The net proceeds released to us from the trust account upon the closing of our &#10; initial business combination may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of &#10; a target business with which we complete our initial business combination. If &#10; our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or &#10; not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the &#10; consideration in connection with our initial business combination, we may use &#10; the balance of the cash released from the trust account following the closing &#10; for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of &#10; operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest &#10; due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to &#10; fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no &#10; limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked &#10; securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with &#10; our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase &#10; agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of &#10; this offering. &#10;  &#10; We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs &#10; and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the &#10; fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in &#10; connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due &#10; diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business &#10; combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or &#10; other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business &#10; combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due &#10; diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the &#10; actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional &#10; capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently &#10; unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek &#10; such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our &#10; sponsors, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons &#10; are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. &#10;  &#10; Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay FEI a total of  &#10; $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative &#10; support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, &#10; we will cease paying these monthly fees. &#10;  &#10; Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsors have agreed to loan us up to &#10; an aggregate of $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this &#10; offering. As of February 28, 2019, we had not borrowed any amounts under the &#10; promissory notes with our sponsors to be used for a portion of the expenses of &#10; this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at &#10; the earlier of September 30, 2019 or the closing of this offering. The loan will &#10; be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of offering proceeds not held in &#10; the trust account. &#10;  &#10; In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an &#10; intended initial business combination, our sponsors or an affiliate of one of &#10; our sponsors or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated &#10; to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business &#10; combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust &#10; account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds &#10; held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business &#10; combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held &#10; outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our &#10; trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of &#10; such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at &#10; the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private &#10; placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise &#10; period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not &#10; been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We &#10; do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsors or an affiliate &#10; of one of our sponsors as we do not believe third parties will be willing to &#10; loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access &#10; to funds in our trust account. &#10;  &#10; If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do &#10; not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination &#10; pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsors, initial stockholders, &#10; directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public &#10; warrants in privately-negotiated transactions or in the open market, either &#10; prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There &#10; is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, &#10; officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, &#10; subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have &#10; no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and &#10; have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they &#10; engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are &#10; in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller &#10; or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We &#10; do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a &#10; tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a &#10; going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange &#10; Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that &#10; the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such &#10; rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 &#10; of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting &#10; requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to &#10; purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of &#10; our initial business combination. &#10;  &#10; The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in &#10; favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of &#10; obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy &#10; a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a &#10; minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial &#10; business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not &#10; be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce &#10; the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any &#10; matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our &#10; initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in &#10; the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have &#10; been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of &#10; our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of &#10; beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult &#10; to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a &#10; national securities exchange. &#10;  &#10; We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net &#10; tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial &#10; business combination and after payment of deferred underwriters’ commissions (so &#10; that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for &#10; our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have &#10; a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders &#10; exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible  &#10; asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed &#10; with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination, &#10; and instead may search for an alternate business combination. &#10;  &#10; A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account &#10; only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business &#10; combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in &#10; connection with a stockholder vote to amend our third amended and restated &#10; certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation &#10; to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business &#10; combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or to provide for &#10; redemption in connection with a business combination and (iii) the redemption of &#10; our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination &#10; within 24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable &#10; law and as further described herein and any limitations (including, but not &#10; limited to, cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial &#10; business combination. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have &#10; any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. &#10;  &#10; Our sponsors, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with &#10; us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with &#10; respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection &#10; with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our &#10; initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating &#10; distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by &#10; them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the &#10; prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsors or any of our officers, &#10; directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they &#10; will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with &#10; respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business &#10; combination within the prescribed time frame.',\n",
       "   'competition': 'In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial &#10; business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a &#10; business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, &#10; private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating &#10; businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are &#10; well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting &#10; business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these &#10; competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than &#10; we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our &#10; available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an &#10; advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. &#10; Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public &#10; stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources &#10; available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding &#10; warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed &#10; favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at &#10; a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business &#10; combination.',\n",

Nalbuphine &#10; is a mixed k-opioid receptor agonist and m-opioid receptor antagonist that has &#10; been approved and marketed as an injectable for pain indications for more than &#10; 20 years in the United States and Europe. The k- and m-opioid receptors are &#10; known to be critical mediators of itch, cough and certain movement disorders. &#10; Nalbuphine’s mechanism of action also mitigates the risk of abuse associated &#10; with m-opioid agonists because it antagonizes, or blocks, the m-opioid receptor. &#10; Nalbuphine is currently the only opioid approved for marketing that is not &#10; classified as a controlled substance in the United States or Europe. &#10;  &#10; We have retained worldwide development and commercial rights for nalbuphine ER  &#10; in all indications. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; Chronic pruritus, defined as itching lasting longer than six weeks, causes a &#10; number of physical and psychological issues that can substantially impact &#10; patients’ daily well-being. The urge to scratch can be unbearable and the act of &#10; scratching can remove layers of skin and break the skin barrier, leading to &#10; bleeding and scarring and greatly increasing the risk of infection. Chronic &#10; pruritus can also lead to trouble sleeping, resulting in loss of work &#10; productivity and increased anxiety and depression as patients struggle to &#10; maintain self-control. Chronic pruritus is a hallmark of many dermatologic and &#10; systemic diseases and is the predominant reason that patients with these &#10; diseases experience so much discomfort. A recent report published in the Journal &#10; of the American Academy of Dermatology estimated that up to 26% of the worldwide &#10; population will suffer from chronic pruritus at some point in their lives. &#10; According to the Global Pruritus Therapeutic Market Research Report issued in &#10; 2017, the market for pruritus therapeutics was $10.8 billion in 2016 and is &#10; expected to grow to $14.3 billion in 2022. Despite the large market opportunity &#10; and the severity of chronic pruritus, there are no drugs approved in the United &#10; States or Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe pruritus. Nalbuphine &#10; ER’s dual mechanism of action targets opioid receptors located in both the &#10; central and peripheral nervous systems, each of which plays a role in modulating &#10; the sensation of itch. We believe this makes nalbuphine ER a promising potential &#10; therapy for the treatment of chronic pruritus. &#10;  &#10; Nalbuphine ER Clinical Development &#10;  &#10; We have completed clinical trials in two distinct and serious pruritic &#10; conditions, uremic pruritus and pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, with &#10; over 400 patients treated with different doses of nalbuphine ER in these trials. &#10; Uremic pruritus is a pruritic condition occurring in patients with chronic &#10; kidney disease typically receiving dialysis. Prurigo nodularis is an intensely &#10; pruritic dermatologic condition characterized by the presence of nodular &#10; pruriginous lesions such as papules or plaques. &#10;  &#10; In our Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in uremic pruritus, we enrolled 373 patients &#10; with moderate to severe uremic pruritus. Patients were randomized to one of &#10; three arms: either 108 mg or 54 mg of nalbuphine ER or placebo, each &#10; administered twice daily. The primary endpoint in the trial was the change from &#10; baseline in patients’ seven-day mean worst itch numerical rating scale, or &#10; WI-NRS, scores, which was met in the 108 mg arm, but not in the 54 mg arm.  &#10; Patients in the 54 mg arm reported a reduction in WI-NRS score that was larger  &#10; than the reduction in the placebo arm, although the difference was not  &#10; statistically significant. The reduction in WI-NRS scores across the three arms &#10; of the trial demonstrated a dose response. &#10;  &#10; In our Phase 2 clinical trial in prurigo nodularis, we enrolled 63 patients with &#10; prurigo nodularis who had moderate to severe pruritus. Patients were randomized &#10; to one of three arms: either 162 mg or 81 mg of nalbuphine ER or placebo, each &#10; administered twice daily. The primary endpoint of the trial was the proportion &#10; of patients reporting at least a 30% reduction from baseline to week 10 in &#10; seven-day mean WI-NRS scores. Although the primary endpoint was not met in &#10; either of the nalbuphine ER arms, a key secondary endpoint of the trial was the &#10; proportion of patients reporting at least a 50% reduction in WI-NRS score from &#10; baseline. In the 162 mg arm, 33% of patients reported at least a 50% reduction &#10; in WI-NRS score as compared to 18% of patients in the placebo arm. The trial met &#10; a key secondary efficacy endpoint, reduction of ItchyQoL™ scores, in the 162 mg &#10; arm compared to the placebo arm. ItchyQoL measures quality of life improvements &#10; from pruritus reduction. The secondary endpoints of the trial were not powered &#10; for statistical significance. &#10;  &#10; We conducted a post hoc analysis of the data from the 50 patients who completed &#10; the 10-weekcourse of treatment in our Phase 2 clinical trial in prurigo &#10; nodularis, whom we refer to as completers. We believe an analysis of the trial &#10; results of this subset of patients provides informative data regarding &#10; nalbuphine ER because it eliminates the effects of patient discontinuations. In &#10; the trial, 50% of the completers in the 162 mg arm reported at least a 50% &#10; reduction in WI-NRS score from baseline, as compared to 20% of the completers in &#10; the placebo arm, although this analysis was not powered for statistical &#10; significance. As the patients in the 162 mg arm had a mean baseline WI-NRS score &#10; of 8.05, a 50% reduction in WI-NRS score from baseline for patients in this arm &#10; was comparable to a 4-point reduction in WI-NRS score, the primary efficacy &#10; endpoint of our PRISM trial. &#10;  &#10; Based on the results of our prurigo nodularis and uremic pruritus trials and &#10; open label extension trials in both indications, and discussions with the FDA &#10; and European regulatory authorities, we initiated our Phase 2b/3 Pruritus Relief &#10; through Itch Scratch Modulation, or PRISM, trial in September 2018. In designing &#10; the statistical plan for the PRISM trial, we considered the rates of patient &#10; discontinuations we experienced in our earlier trials. We believe that these &#10; discontinuation rates can be reduced through increased patient and physician &#10; education prior to the commencement of dosing. We expect to report top-line data &#10; from the 14-week blinded treatment period of the PRISM trial in the first half &#10; of 2020. We will need to conduct an additional Phase 3 clinical trial to support &#10; the submission of an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for nalbuphine ER for &#10; the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis. We may initiate &#10; this trial before the PRISM trial is complete. &#10;  &#10; We have also commenced a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with chronic liver &#10; disease to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-pruritic effect of &#10; nalbuphine ER in this population, with data expected in the second half of 2019. &#10; If positive, we also intend to use data from this trial to support an NDA &#10; submission for nalbuphine ER in prurigo nodularis and commence a Phase 2 &#10; clinical trial for pruritus associated with chronic liver disease. We are not &#10; actively developing nalbuphine ER for uremic pruritus at this time based on our &#10; evaluation of the market dynamics, but may consider resuming development in the &#10; future. &#10;  &#10; As a result of nalbuphine’s ability to modulate the k- and m-opioid receptors, &#10; which are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of chronic cough in &#10; patients with IPF and in LID in patients with Parkinson’s disease, we are also &#10; pursuing the development of nalbuphine ER for each of these indications. In the &#10; first half of 2019, we intend to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate &#10; the safety of nalbuphine ER in patients with IPF, and make an initial assessment &#10; of its efficacy on cough, with data expected in the first half of 2020. Subject &#10; to discussions with the FDA and the submission of an investigational new drug &#10; application for this indication, we also intend to initiate a Phase 2 clinical &#10; trial of nalbuphine ER in the second half of 2019 to evaluate the effect of &#10; nalbuphine ER on LID in patients with Parkinson’s disease. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 17, 2011 &#10; under the name Trevi Therapeutics, Inc.

       "   'useOfProceeds': 'We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of 5,500,000 shares &#10; of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $48.7 million, or &#10; $56.3 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 825,000 &#10; additional shares in full, assuming an initial public offering price of $10.00 &#10; per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated &#10; offering expenses payable by us. We also expect to receive net proceeds of $14.0 &#10; million from the sale of shares of our common stock to New Enterprise &#10; Associates, or NEA, in the proposed concurrent private placement, based on the &#10; assumed initial public offering price of $10.00 per share and after deducting &#10; estimated placement agent fees payable by us, for aggregate net proceeds to be &#10; raised by us in this offering and the concurrent private placement of $62.6 &#10; million. Because we have not entered into any definitive agreements with NEA &#10; related to the proposed concurrent private placement, there can be no guarantee &#10; that the proposed concurrent private placement will take place or that the terms &#10; of the proposed concurrent private placement will be consistent with those &#10; assumed in this prospectus. &#10;  &#10; A $1.00 decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $10.00 per &#10; share would decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately &#10; $5.1 million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us in this offering, &#10; as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after &#10; deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses &#10; payable by us, and both assuming completion of the proposed concurrent private &#10; placement, the proceeds of which would be unaffected by such decrease, and &#10; deduction of estimated placement agent fees. An increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 &#10; shares in the number of shares offered by us in this offering, as set forth on &#10; the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to &#10; us from this offering and the proposed concurrent private placement by &#10; approximately $9.3 million, assuming no change in the assumed initial public &#10; offering price per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and &#10; commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and both assuming &#10; completion of the proposed concurrent private placement and deduction of &#10; estimated placement agent fees. &#10;  &#10; As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.2 million. We &#10; currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering, &#10; together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows: &#10;  &#10; • approximately $7.5 million to $13.5 million to fund the development of     &#10;   nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis; &#10;  &#10; • approximately $5.0 million to $7.5 million to fund the development of      &#10;   nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with chronic liver  &#10;   disease; &#10;  &#10; • approximately $4.0 million to $8.0 million to fund the development of      &#10;   nalbuphine ER for the treatment of chronic cough in patients with IPF;  &#10;  &#10; • approximately $5.5 million to $7.5 million to fund the development of      &#10;   nalbuphine ER for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson’s disease; &#10;   and &#10;  &#10; • the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes. &#10;  &#10; We currently estimate that, if we receive additional net proceeds of $14.0 &#10; million from the sale of shares of our common stock to NEA in the proposed &#10; concurrent private placement, we will use such net proceeds as follows: &#10;  &#10; • approximately $2.5 to $4.0 million to fund the development of nalbuphine ER &#10;   for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis; &#10;  &#10; • approximately $1.0 to $1.5 million to fund the development of nalbuphine ER &#10;   for the treatment of pruritus associated with chronic liver disease; &#10;  &#10; • approximately $1.0 to $2.0 million to fund the development of nalbuphine ER &#10;   for the treatment of chronic cough in patients with IPF; &#10;  &#10; • approximately $1.5 to $2.5 million to fund the development of nalbuphine ER &#10;   for the treatment of LID in patients with Parkinson’s disease; and &#10;  &#10; • the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes. &#10;  &#10; Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and the net proceeds, if &#10; any, from the proposed concurrent private placement and our existing cash and &#10; cash equivalents represents our intentions based on our current plans and &#10; business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business &#10; conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary &#10; significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our &#10; clinical development of nalbuphine ER, the status of and results from our &#10; clinical trials, including our ongoing PRISM trial as well as the additional &#10; Phase 3 clinical trial we will need to conduct for nalbuphine ER for pruritus &#10; associated with prurigo nodularis, the timing of regulatory submissions and the &#10; outcome of regulatory review, as well as any collaborations that we may enter &#10; into with third parties and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, we cannot &#10; predict with certainty the expenditures that may be necessary to complete the &#10; clinical development and commercialization of nalbuphine ER for any indication &#10; and our management will retain broad discretion over the application of the net &#10; proceeds from this offering and the net proceeds, if any, from the proposed &#10; concurrent private placement. &#10;  &#10; Based on our current plans, we believe that the anticipated net proceeds from &#10; this offering and the net proceeds, if any, from the proposed concurrent private &#10; placement, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us &#10; to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through the &#10; end of 2020. In particular, we expect that the anticipated net proceeds from &#10; this offering and the net proceeds, if any, from the proposed concurrent private &#10; placement, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will enable us &#10; to complete our ongoing PRISM trial, our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial in &#10; patients with chronic liver disease, our planned Phase 2 clinical trial for &#10; chronic cough in patients with IPF and our planned Phase 2 clinical trial for &#10; LID in patients with Parkinson’s disease. However, we do not expect these funds &#10; will be sufficient to complete the clinical development of nalbuphine ER for &#10; pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis and other indications, commercialize &#10; nalbuphine ER (if we receive regulatory approval) for pruritus associated with &#10; prurigo nodularis and other indications, and pursue the development and &#10; commercialization of any future product candidate. We do not have any committed &#10; external source of funds. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further &#10; funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, &#10; collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources to complete the &#10; clinical development and commercialization of nalbuphine ER for pruritus &#10; associated with prurigo nodularis or any other indication. &#10;  &#10; Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering and the net proceeds, if &#10; any, from the proposed concurrent private placement, we intend to invest the net &#10; proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term, &#10; investment-grade,interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government securities.',\n",
       "   'competition': 'The biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and is subject to rapid &#10; and significant change. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, &#10; experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we &#10; face potential competition from many sources, including major pharmaceutical, &#10; specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. If we are able to &#10; successfully develop and commercialize nalbuphine ER, it would compete with &#10; existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. &#10;  &#10; Chronic Pruritus &#10;  &#10; We are developing nalbuphine ER for the treatment of pruritus associated with &#10; prurigo nodularis. Currently, there are no products approved in the United &#10; States or Europe for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo &#10; nodularis, however there are many products that are used to help manage pruritus &#10; associated with prurigo nodularis with which we expect that nalbuphine ER would &#10; compete if it is approved in this indication. The most common of these agents &#10; are anti-itch creams and emollients as well as oral or injectable &#10; antihistamines. All of these products have limited degrees of efficacy and are &#10; available generically. Additionally, patients may try several other agents such &#10; as gabapentin and Lyrica (pregabalin), which are prescription medicines approved &#10; for the treatment of seizures and neuropathic pain, naltrexone and UVB light &#10; therapy, generally with limited success. If approved for the treatment of &#10; pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, we expect that nalbuphine ER might &#10; also compete with product candidates currently in clinical development in this &#10; indication, including serlopitant, an oral neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist &#10; being developed by Menlo Therapeutics that is in Phase 3 clinical trials; &#10; nemolizumab, an anti-interleukin-31 receptor A humanized monoclonal antibody &#10; being developed by Galderma; and KPL-716, a monoclonal antibody targeting &#10; oncostatin M receptor beta being developed by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals. In &#10; addition, a number of other product candidates are currently in clinical &#10; development to treat other pruritic conditions and nalbuphine ER, if approved &#10; for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis or another &#10; pruritic condition, could face competition from these product candidates. These &#10; product candidates include KORSUVA, a k-opioid receptor agonist being developed &#10; by Cara Therapeutics that is in Phase 3 clinical trials for administration by &#10; injection for uremic pruritus and earlier-stage clinical trials for oral &#10; administration for uremic pruritus and pruritus associated with chronic liver &#10; disease, and tradipitant, an oral neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist being &#10; developed by Vanda Pharmaceuticals that is in Phase 3 clinical trials for &#10; chronic pruritus in patients with atopic dermatitis. &#10;  &#10; If approved for the treatment of pruritus associated with chronic liver disease, &#10; nalbuphine ER may also compete with bile acid sequestrants, such as &#10; cholestyramine, which are used off label and generally as first-line therapy, &#10; although they typically provide only modest relief. Cholestyramine is marketed &#10; as Questran in the United States and as Colestyr, Efensol, Ipocol, Kolestran, &#10; Lipocol, Olestyr, Prevalite or Quantalan in various other countries. Nalbuphine &#10; ER may also complete with second-line therapies such as the antibiotic &#10; rifampicin, naltrexone, the anti-depressant sertraline, as well as phototherapy &#10; and drugs such as gabapentin and Lyrica (pregabalin), which are approved for the &#10; treatment of seizures and neuropathic pain. In addition, it is possible that &#10; therapies to reduce chronic liver disease, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, which &#10; is approved for the treatment of PBC, could reduce the need for therapies to &#10; treat pruritus associated with chronic liver disease. &#10;  &#10; Chronic Cough in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis &#10;  &#10; If nalbuphine ER is approved for the treatment of chronic cough associated with &#10; idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we expect that it would compete with RVT-1601, a &#10; formulation of cromolyn sodium being developed by Respivant Sciences, and expect &#10; that it might also compete with other product candidates currently in &#10; development for the treatment of chronic cough by companies including Merck and &#10; Nerre Therapeutics. In addition, it is possible that product candidates &#10; currently in development for the treatment of IPF could, if approved, reduce the &#10; need for therapies to treat chronic cough associated with IPF. &#10;  &#10; Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia in Parkinson’s Disease &#10;  &#10; If nalbuphine ER is approved for the treatment of LID in patients with &#10; Parkinson’s disease, we expect that it would compete with Gocovri, an extended &#10; release capsule formulation of amantadine marketed by Adamas Pharmaceuticals, &#10; and expect that it might also compete with other product candidates currently in &#10; development for the treatment of LID by companies including Lundbeck, Addex &#10; Therapeutics and IRLAB Therapeutics. In addition, it is possible that product &#10; candidates currently in development for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease by &#10; companies could, if approved, reduce the need for therapies to treat LID. &#10;  &#10; Many of our competitors and potential competitors, either alone or with their &#10; strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human &#10; resources and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development &#10; of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products &#10; and commercializing products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the &#10; biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources &#10; being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors &#10; also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and &#10; management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling &#10; patients for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary &#10; to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also &#10; prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative &#10; arrangements with large and established companies. &#10;  &#10; We expect that nalbuphine ER, if approved for marketing, will compete on the &#10; basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, health-economic benefit, &#10; convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic &#10; competition and the availability of adequate reimbursement from government and &#10; other third-party payors. &#10;  &#10; Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors &#10; develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or &#10; less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than &#10; nalbuphine ER. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval &#10; for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for nalbuphine ER, &#10; which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position &#10; before we are able to enter the market.',\n",

       "   'useOfProceeds': 'We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of shares of our common &#10; stock in this offering will be approximately $462.9 million, based upon the &#10; assumed initial public offering price of $27.00 per share, which is the midpoint &#10; of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this &#10; prospectus, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and &#10; estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their &#10; option to purchase additional shares in full, we estimate that the net proceeds &#10; to be received by us will be approximately $533.8 million, after deducting &#10; underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by &#10; us. &#10;  &#10; A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of &#10; $27.00 per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds that we receive from &#10; this offering by approximately $17.5 million, assuming that the number of shares &#10; offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the &#10; same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and &#10; estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, each increase (decrease) &#10; of 1.0 million in the number of shares offered by us would increase (decrease) &#10; the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately $25.5 &#10; million, assuming that the assumed initial public offering price remains the &#10; same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and &#10; estimated offering expenses payable by us. &#10;  &#10; The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and &#10; financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and thereby &#10; enable access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders. We &#10; intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to fund the IPO Dividend &#10; of $52.1 million, repay the outstanding balance of $150.5 million under our Term &#10; Loan and repay outstanding indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility. &#10;  &#10; In January 2019, we borrowed $150.0 million under our Term Loan Agreement to &#10; partially finance the OGSystems Acquisition. Our Term Loan is comprised of &#10; Offshore Rate Loans and Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the Term Loan &#10; Agreement), with an initial aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million. The &#10; Offshore Rate Loans bear interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR, divided by 1.00 &#10; minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, plus 1.25%. The Base Rate Loans bear &#10; interest at a rate per annum of the sum of (a) the highest of (1) the &#10; administrative agent’s reference rate; (2) the rate equal to 1.50% per annum &#10; above the Offshore Rate; and (3) the rate equal to 0.50% per annum above the &#10; latest federal funds rate, plus (b) 0.25%. The Term Loan has a maturity date of &#10; January 3, 2020. We intend to use $150.5 million of our net proceeds from this &#10; offering to repay the outstanding balance under our Term Loan upon the &#10; consummation of this offering. &#10;  &#10; As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding indebtedness under our Revolving Credit &#10; Facility was $180.0 million, which does not include $110.0 million we borrowed &#10; under our Revolving Credit Facility in January 2019 to partially finance the &#10; OGSystems Acquisition. In May 2018, we borrowed $260.0 million under our &#10; Revolving Credit Facility to partially finance the acquisition of Polaris Alpha. &#10; Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, borrowings under our Revolving Credit &#10; Facility bear interest, at our option, at either the Base Rate (as defined in &#10; the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin, or LIBOR plus an applicable &#10; margin. The applicable margin for Base Rate loans is a range of 0.125% to 1.00% &#10; and the applicable margin for LIBOR loans is a range of 1.125% to 2.00%, both &#10; based on our leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Credit &#10; Agreement has a maturity date of November 15, 2022. &#10;  &#10; We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this &#10; offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management &#10; regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending the &#10; use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to invest the net &#10; proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term and long-term &#10; interest-bearing obligations, including government- and investment-grade debt &#10; securities and money market funds. &#10;  &#10; Affiliates of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo &#10; Securities, LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc. and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. are &#10; each a lender under the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. A portion of &#10; the net proceeds from this offering will be used to repay borrowings under the &#10; Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, we expect more than 5% of &#10; the net proceeds from this offering will be paid to affiliates of each of &#10; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, &#10; MUFG Securities Americas Inc. and Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. Therefore, this &#10; offering is being made in compliance with FINRA Rule 5121. As a result of this &#10; conflict of interest, Goldman Sachs & Co.

In certain  &#10; geographies and specific segments, we compete mainly with offline media, such &#10; as local newspapers with a jobs classifieds section. &#10;  &#10; Our international competitors include or may in the future include global &#10; professional networks, such as LinkedIn, job portals and aggregators, such as &#10; Indeed, HR technology companies and players who operate adjacent business &#10; models, including social networks, such as Facebook, and search engines, such as &#10; Google, who recently introduced its enhanced job search user function called &#10; “Google for Jobs” in Russia. The competition from international players is &#10; currently limited, given that Russia is perceived as a market with strong &#10; domestic Internet players, as well as Russia’s regulatory regime, compliance &#10; with which entails significant investments and costs, such as the requirement to &#10; store personal data of Russian citizens within Russia as prescribed by the Law &#10; on Personal Data. Notably, access to LinkedIn’s resources in Russia was blocked &#10; by the Roskomnadzor in November 2016 as a result of LinkedIn’s failure to  &#10; comply with this regulation. We believe we are advantageously positioned  &#10; against our indirect competitors, such as social networks and search engines. &#10;  &#10; Because our CV database, traffic to our website and the range of additional &#10; services for employers exceed those of our competitors, we view premium pricing &#10; of our services to be justified and sustainable. We have historically been able &#10; to retain our customers and attract new ones while periodically increasing the &#10; prices for our services. &#10;  &#10; The main monetization model adopted in the Russian online recruitment market is &#10; either providing paid access to a CV database, charging a fee per job posting or &#10; a combination thereof. Should some international players, such as Indeed, expand &#10; their operations in Russia and propose to the market an alternative monetisation &#10; model adopted elsewhere, such as CPC, we might be forced to change our business &#10; model accordingly. However, we believe that with successful introduction of our &#10; ClickMe product, which operates on the CPC model, we believe we are well &#10; positioned and prepared for such challenges. &#10;  &#10; The competition in HCM services is largely fragmented and differs across various &#10; types of services. Currently, key competitors in broader HCM space are large &#10; international, such as Oracle and SAP, and local, such as 1C and IBS, IT service &#10; providers, while future competition may arise from growing HR technology &#10; start-up companies, as well as new developing business and monetization models, &#10; such as recruiting chat bots or advertising agencies, providing recruiting &#10; services on cost-per-acquisition basis.',\n",

The result of this unique multifaceted approach &#10; to drug development is a portfolio of highly specific and selective product  &#10; candidates that we believe are significantly de-risked and can move quickly  &#10; through the development process. &#10;  &#10; Our first molecular target is aldose reductase, or AR, the first enzyme and &#10; rate-limiting step in the polyol pathway, an alternative glucose metabolism &#10; pathway. AR is a redox-regulated enzyme that is activated by an altered redox &#10; state within the cell, such as oxidative stress, which occurs during &#10; hyperglycemia and ischemia. AR activity produces excess sorbitol, which causes &#10; osmotic dysregulation within cells and tissues, and is implicated in multiple &#10; diseases. The detrimental consequences of aberrent AR activation include broad &#10; effects, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death, as well as &#10; tissue-specific changes, such as neuronal degeneration in peripheral nerves, &#10; collagen crosslinking and fibrosis in cardiac tissue, and damage to blood &#10; vessels in the lens of the eye. Prior attempts to inhibit this enzyme were &#10; hindered by nonselective, nonspecific inhibition, which resulted in limited &#10; efficacy and significant off-target safety effects. Our AR inhibitor, or ARI, &#10; program currently includes three small molecules, which are all designed to be &#10; potent and selective ARIs, and are engineered to have unique tissue permeability &#10; profiles to target different disease states, including diabetic complications, &#10; heart disease and a rare pediatric metabolic disease. &#10;  &#10; Our lead product candidate, AT-001, is a novel ARI with broad systemic exposure &#10; and peripheral nerve permeability, that we are developing for the treatment of  &#10; diabetic cardiomyopathy, or DbCM, a fatal fibrosis of the heart, for which no  &#10; treatments are available. DbCM is estimated to afflict 17% of diabetic patients, &#10; equating to an estimated 77 million patients globally. We initially plan to  &#10; target the 50% of these patients who are within the symptomatic stages of  &#10; disease we believe most likely to be responsive to treatment. We are also  &#10; developing AT-001 for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or DPN, a debilitating &#10; neurodegenerative disease that significantly reduces quality of life, and for &#10; which there are currently no approved treatments in the United States.  &#10; Approximately 50% of the global diabetic population, or 226 million diabetic &#10; patients, suffer from DPN. We recently completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial  &#10; evaluating AT-001 in approximately 120 patients with type 2 diabetes, in which &#10; no drug-related adverse effects or tolerability issues were observed. This trial &#10; also demonstrated target engagement and proof of biological activity, as  &#10; measured by reduction in sorbitol, a biomarker of AR activity, and NTproBNP, a &#10; marker of cardiac stress. We plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial &#10; of AT-001 for the treatment of DbCM in 2019. We plan to collect data on motor &#10; nerve conduction velocity, or MNCV, in our planned pivotal trial in DbCM  &#10; patients that also have DPN, which we expect will provide a basis for dose &#10; selection in Phase 3 clinical trials of DPN. &#10;  &#10; Our second product candidate, AT-007, is a central nervous system, or CNS,  &#10; penetrant ARI that we are developing for the treatment of galactosemia, a &#10; devastating rare pediatric metabolic disease that affects how the body processes &#10; a simple sugar called galactose, and for which there is no known cure or &#10; approved treatment available. We estimate that the U.S. galactosemia population &#10; is approximately 2,800 patients, based on newborn screening data identifying &#10; 2,500 infants through 2014, and the estimated birth rate of 80 patients per &#10; year. High levels of galactose circulating in the blood and tissues of &#10; galactosemia patients enable AR to convert galactose to a toxic metabolite, &#10; galactitol, which results in long-term complications ranging from CNS &#10; dysfunction to cataracts. We have demonstrated in an animal model of &#10; galactosemia that treatment with AT-007 reduces toxic galactitol levels and &#10; prevents disease complications. We believe that galactosemia may qualify for &#10; accelerated approval, as well as for the rare pediatric disease priority review &#10; voucher, or RPD-PRV, program. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug &#10; Administration, or FDA, recently released draft guidance for industry on drug &#10; development for low prevalence, slowly progressing rare metabolic diseases, for &#10; which we believe galactosemia qualifies. The guidance allows for a &#10; biomarker-based development program if clinical efficacy and a link to a &#10; relevant biomarker can be demonstrated in an animal model of disease. We are &#10; currently in late stages of preclinical development and intend to advance AT-007 &#10; into a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2019. &#10;  &#10; We are also developing AT-003, an ARI designed to cross through the back of the &#10; eye when dosed orally, which has demonstrated strong retinal penetrance, for the &#10; treatment of diabetic retinopathy, or DR. DR is an ophthalmic disease that &#10; occurs in diabetic patients and for which treatments are currently limited to &#10; high-cost biologics requiring intravitreal administration. DR afflicts &#10; approximately 35% of diabetic patients, equating to an estimated 158 million &#10; patients globally. DR has been linked to AR activity, including elevations in &#10; sorbitol and subsequent changes in retinal blood vessels, which distorts vision &#10; and leads to permanent blindness. We are currently in late stages of preclinical &#10; development of AT-003. AT-003 displayed significant retinal penetration when &#10; dosed orally in diabetic rats. The drug was observed to be well tolerated with &#10; no adverse effects. Efficacy of AT-003 is currently being explored in two animal &#10; models of DR—an ischemic injury model (acute damage) and chronic diabetic &#10; treatment model. We intend to advance AT-003 into a Phase 1 clinical trial in &#10; 2020. &#10;  &#10; Applying our strategy from our ARI program, we have also developed a program &#10; targeting selective inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or PI3K, &#10; subunits that has resulted in an early-stage oncology pipeline. We expect to &#10; initially target orphan hematological oncology indications, including peripheral &#10; T-cell lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and T-cell acute lymphoblastic &#10; leukemia. We are additionally developing selective alpha/gamma inhibitors to &#10; target solid tumors that constitutively express PI3K alpha. We plan to initiate &#10; our clinical program in these indications in 2020. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 20,  &#10; 2016.

Similarly, each increase or &#10; decrease of 1.0 million shares of common stock offered by us, would increase or &#10; decrease the net proceeds to us by $14.0 million, assuming the assumed initial &#10; public offering price per share remains the same, and after deducting the &#10; estimated underwriting discounts and commissions. &#10;  &#10; The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and &#10; financial flexibility, establish a public market for our common stock and to &#10; facilitate future access to the public equity markets by us, our employees and &#10; our stockholders, obtain additional capital to support our operations and &#10; increase our visibility in the marketplace. &#10;  &#10; We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with &#10; our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows: &#10;  &#10; • approximately $30 million to fund our pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial for &#10;   AT-001 for the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy; &#10;  &#10; • approximately $5 million to advance AT-007 for the treatment of galactosemia  &#10;   in adults through our planned Phase 1 clinical trial; &#10;  &#10; • approximately $4 million to advance AT-003 for the treatment of diabetic  &#10;   retinopathy into our planned Phase 1 clinical trial; and &#10;  &#10; • the remainder to fund other research and development activities, working  &#10;   capital and other general corporate purposes. &#10;  &#10; We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire &#10; or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.  &#10; However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do so. &#10;  &#10; This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our  &#10; intentions based on our current plans and business conditions, which could &#10; change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. Further, due &#10; to the uncertainties inherent in the drug development process, it is difficult &#10; to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds from this &#10; offering that may be used for the above purposes. &#10;  &#10; Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from &#10; this offering, and our investors will be relying on the judgment of our &#10; management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. The &#10; amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors &#10; including the results of our research and development efforts, the timing and &#10; success of preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical &#10; trials we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions and &#10; the amount of cash obtained through current and any future collaborations. &#10;  &#10; The expected net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash and cash &#10; equivalents, will not be sufficient for us to fund any of our product candidates &#10; through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise additional capital to &#10; complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We &#10; expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt &#10; financings and potential collaborations, and license and development agreements. &#10; We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and &#10; we could expend our available capital resources at a rate greater than we  &#10; currently expect. &#10;  &#10; Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering as described above, we  &#10; intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation  &#10; instruments, including short-term, interest-bearing obligations,  &#10; investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed &#10; obligations of the U.S. government.',\n",
       "   'competition': 'The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, &#10; intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we  &#10; believe that our technology, the expertise of our executive and scientific team, &#10; research, clinical capabilities, development experience and scientific knowledge &#10; provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many &#10; different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,  &#10; academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research &#10; institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize &#10; may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available &#10; in the future. &#10;  &#10; Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established &#10; presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing,  &#10; preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and  &#10; reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also &#10; compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, &#10; marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and &#10; patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies &#10; complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage &#10; companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through &#10; collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. &#10;  &#10; There are currently no therapies approved to treat DbCM. Entresto, a drug  &#10; developed by Novartis International AG, or Novartis, is approved for acute heart &#10; failure, which can be caused by many conditions, including DbCM. However, we are &#10; aware that Novartis may be pursuing a label expansion for earlier treatment of &#10; generalized heart failure, which may overlap with our target disease stages in &#10; DbCM. Additionally, sponsors of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2, or SGLT2, &#10; inhibitors are pursuing broad cardiovascular labels in type 2 diabetes patients, &#10; which may include a subset of DbCM patients as part of the larger diabetic &#10; population at risk for heart failure. We are also aware of planned Phase 2 &#10; clinical trials on glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, agonists in DbCM, as well &#10; as anti-fibrotic therapies in Phase 1 clinical development. Many of these &#10; programs are sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies with a strong presence &#10; in cardiology and metabolic disease. Additionally, stem-cell targeted &#10; initiatives are in various stages of preclinical and early clinical development &#10; to stimulate regeneration of cardiac tissue to counter fibrosis in DbCM. There &#10; have been prior studies demonstrating effectiveness in DbCM of off-label use of &#10; sildenafil, although we do not believe this represents a commercially viable &#10; competitive threat. &#10;  &#10; There are no disease modifying therapies approved to treat DPN outside of Japan, &#10; India and China. In these limited markets, epalrestat, another ARI, is approved &#10; to prevent worsening of DPN, and despite challenges in compliance due to  &#10; frequent dosing three to five times daily, the drugs are generic and offer a low &#10; cost alternative. A more effective therapy with improved tolerability and dosing &#10; may offer an advantage. A re-formulation of proprietary crystalline epalrestat, &#10; BNV-222, is in development for DPN in Russia in a 12-month Phase 2/3 clinical  &#10; trial, which completed enrollment in 2016, but has not yet reported any results. &#10;  &#10; There are currently no therapies approved to treat galactosemia. Due to the &#10; importance of GALK and GALT enzymes within neurons in the CNS, we believe that &#10; enzyme replacement therapy is not an effective approach in this indication. &#10; Additionally, numerous mutations across ethnicities are responsible for loss of &#10; function in GALK or GALT, which presents significant challenges to potential &#10; gene editing approaches. &#10;  &#10; There are several therapies approved to treat severe or late-stage forms of &#10; DR, or proliferative DR, such as diabetic macular edema and proliferative DR, &#10; including anti-VEGF therapies, Lucentis and Eylea, which represents  &#10; approximately 20% of the larger DR population. There are currently no therapies &#10; approved to treat non-proliferative DR, an earlier stage of the disease  &#10; upstream of vessel or capillary proliferation. However, there are significant  &#10; additional clinical development efforts for other mechanistic interventions in &#10; early-stage or for non-proliferative DR. &#10;  &#10; The following table summarizes the current competitive landscape for our initial &#10; target indications: &#10;  &#10; Disease               Product Type                    Stage of Development             &#10; DbCM             Entresto                 Approved for late stages of generalized      &#10;                  (sacubitril/valsartan)   cardiac heart failure; may pursue earlier    &#10;                                           stages of heart failure that may overlap     &#10;                                           with DbCM                                    &#10;                  SGLT2 inhibitors         Approved for glucose control with additional &#10;                                           label claiming cardiovascular benefit in     &#10;                                           diabetics; may achieve specific label in     &#10;                                           DbCM in future studies                       &#10;                  GLP-1 agonists           Approved; additional studies examining       &#10;                                           direct CV benefit in DbCM anticipated        &#10;                  Anti-fibrotic            Preclinical to Phase 1; may prevent collagen &#10;                  therapies                cross-linking and B-catenin remodeling       &#10; DPN              Epalrestat (ARI);        Approved as a generic in Japan, China and    &#10;                                           India                                        &#10;                  BNV-22 epalrestat        Attempt to reformulate as a novel product in &#10;                  reformulation            Russia in Phase 2/3 trial (no information    &#10;                                           available since 2016)                        &#10; Galactosemia                              None identified                              &#10; DR               Anti-VEGFs (Lucentis;    Approved for proliferative forms of DR—only  &#10;                  Eylea)                   20% of DR population                         &#10;                  Other mechanisms         Phase 2a development for non-proliferative   &#10;                                           DR',\n",

We are focused on patients who do not respond to &#10; current therapies, patients whose cancer progresses despite treatment and &#10; patients with cancer types not adequately addressed by available therapies. We &#10; are committed to discovering and developing first-in-class immunomedicines, &#10; which are immunomedicines that use new or unique mechanisms of action to treat a &#10; medical condition, for these patients. &#10;  &#10; Our lead product candidate, NC318, is a first-in-class immunomedicine against a &#10; novel immunomodulatory receptor called Siglec-15, or S15. In October 2018, we &#10; initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of NC318 in patients with advanced or  &#10; metastatic solid tumors. We expect completion of the Phase 1 portion of this  &#10; trial in the fourth quarter of 2019 and completion of the Phase 2 portion in the &#10; fourth quarter of 2020. Our second product candidate, NC410, is a novel  &#10; immunomedicine designed to block immune suppression mediated by an immune  &#10; modulator called Leukocyte-Associated Immunoglobulin-like Receptor 1, or LAIR-1. &#10; We expect to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the U.S. &#10; Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for NC410 in the first quarter of 2020. &#10;  &#10; Our approach to identifying targets for new immunomedicines is based on our  &#10; FIND-IO platform. FIND-IO embodies a rational approach to the discovery of novel &#10; cell surface and secretory molecules that drive functional immune responses. We &#10; use our immunology knowledge, experience, capabilities and tools we have &#10; developed, including our FIND-IO platform, to support our discovery efforts. We &#10; are working to discover novel targets that play a key role in mediating immune &#10; dysfunction that allows tumors to evade the immune system. We are seeking to &#10; identify and develop immunomedicines that counteract these outcomes and to &#10; further validate and advance our product candidates. We have identified multiple &#10; novel targets using our FIND-IO platform, including those for which certain of &#10; our research programs are being designed to target. In addition, the &#10; immunosuppressive properties of S15, the target of NC318, were discovered using &#10; a predecessor of our FIND-IO platform. &#10;  &#10; The advancement of cancer to late stages indicates a failure of the immune  &#10; system to mount an effective anti-tumor immune response. Immuno-oncology, which &#10; focuses on stimulating the immune system to respond to cancer and includes &#10; checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-L1, PD-1 and CTLA-4, is one of the most &#10; significant advances in the history of cancer treatment. In 2011, the first &#10; checkpoint inhibitor was approved, and today, despite only a modest breadth of &#10; efficacy, this class of therapies is estimated to have had global sales of more &#10; than $17 billion in 2018 and is predicted to reach more than $33 billion in &#10; global sales by 2022. However, despite the recent success of checkpoint &#10; inhibitors, efficacy has been limited. It is estimated that up to 60% to 70% of &#10; cancer patients, including those with melanoma, renal cell cancer, colorectal &#10; cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, urothelial cancer and head and neck squamous &#10; cell carcinoma, do not respond to single-agent therapy with checkpoint &#10; inhibitors. In addition, some patients develop resistance after initial &#10; treatment with these therapies. As a result, the standard of care in cancer  &#10; today leaves many patients underserved. We believe broader efficacy and more &#10; meaningful clinical responses in oncology may be obtained by focusing on the  &#10; tumor microenvironment, or TME. &#10;  &#10; We are using our FIND-IO platform as our discovery engine to identify targets  &#10; and develop immunomedicines that restore normal immune function in the TME  &#10; through novel mechanisms of action. Since our founding in 2015, we have  &#10; developed, industrialized and optimized our FIND-IO platform based on the  &#10; immunological expertise of our management team and the scientific leadership of &#10; our scientific founder, Dr. Lieping Chen. Our approach in creating the FIND-IO &#10; platform, and how we apply it, reflects our belief in the importance of  &#10; understanding biological pathways of all cells in the immune system and  &#10; restoring normal immune function. The platform uses our proprietary approaches &#10; to assess the suppressive or stimulatory function of immune pathways in T cells &#10; and other immune cells, as measured by effects on proliferation or induction of &#10; molecules known to impact immune responses, such as cytokines, which are &#10; signaling molecules secreted by cells in the immune system that mediate and &#10; regulate immunity and inflammation. We study primary immune cells from healthy &#10; donors and from patients with various diseases, as well as established cell &#10; lines from immune and non-immune cell lineages, including T cell subsets, &#10; monocytes, macrophage subpopulations and cancer cell lines. In oncology, we are &#10; using the FIND-IO platform to discover immunomedicines with the potential to &#10; intervene or modulate interactions of immune cells within the TME to restore &#10; anti-tumor activity. We are also expanding the functional screening approach of &#10; our FIND-IO platform for the identification of novel targets in other serious &#10; illnesses outside of oncology, including autoimmune, inflammatory and &#10; neuro-inflammatory diseases. &#10;  &#10; In November 2018, we entered into a multi-year collaboration agreement with Eli &#10; Lilly and Company, or Lilly, focused on the discovery and development of  &#10; immunomedicines for oncology using our FIND-IO platform. The collaboration seeks &#10; to discover novel cancer targets utilizing our platform and provides that we and &#10; Lilly will each receive options to exclusively develop antibodies resulting from &#10; the collaboration. In connection with the agreement, we received an upfront  &#10; payment of $25.0 million in cash and an equity investment of $15.0 million and &#10; are eligible to receive development and regulatory milestones and sales &#10; milestones in an aggregate of up to $1.4 billion, as well as royalty payments. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We were incorporated in Delaware in September 2015.

       "   'useOfProceeds': 'We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in &#10; this offering will be approximately $66.6 million, or approximately $77.0  &#10; million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares &#10; in full, assuming an initial public offering price of $15.00 per share  &#10; (the midpoint of the estimated price range set forth on the cover of this  &#10; prospectus), and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and  &#10; commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. &#10;  &#10; Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of &#10; $15.00 per share (the midpoint of the estimated price range set forth on the  &#10; cover of this prospectus) would increase or decrease, respectively, the net &#10; proceeds from this offering by approximately $4.7 million, assuming the number &#10; of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover of this prospectus, remains &#10; the same and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions &#10; and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We may also increase or decrease &#10; the number of shares we are offering. An increase or decrease of 1.0 million in &#10; the number of shares we are offering would increase or decrease, respectively, &#10; the net proceeds from this offering, after deducting estimated underwriting &#10; discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, by &#10; approximately $14.0 million, assuming the initial public offering price remains &#10; the same. We do not expect that a change in the initial public offering price or &#10; the number of shares offered by us by these amounts would have a material effect &#10; on our intended use of the net proceeds from this offering, although it may &#10; impact the amount of time prior to which we may need to seek additional capital. &#10;  &#10; As of December 31, 2018, we had $135.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We &#10; intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing  &#10; cash and cash equivalents, as follows: &#10;          &#10; • approximately $113.0 million to advance NC318 through completion of our  &#10;   ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced or metastatic &#10;   solid tumors and into a Phase 3 clinical trial; &#10;  &#10; • approximately $31.0 million to advance NC410 through completion of a Phase 1/2 &#10;   clinical trial; and &#10;  &#10; • the remainder for research and development activities related to our FIND-IO &#10;   platform and discovery programs, including advancement of two discovery  &#10;   programs through submission of INDs, personnel expenses, working capital and &#10;   other general corporate purposes, including a $500,000 payment to Yale &#10;   University that is due upon the closing of this offering. &#10;  &#10; Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our  &#10; intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could &#10; change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. As of the date &#10; of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses &#10; for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or the &#10; amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and &#10; timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of our research and development &#10; activities may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the &#10; progress of our development efforts, the timing and costs associated with the &#10; manufacture and supply of any of our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash &#10; needs. As a result, our management will have broad discretion over the use of &#10; the net proceeds from this offering. &#10;  &#10; Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this &#10; offering in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of  &#10; deposit or government securities. &#10;  &#10; We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the net &#10; proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations &#10; into the second half of 2022. We have based this estimate on assumptions that  &#10; may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources  &#10; sooner than we currently expect. After this offering, we will require &#10; substantial additional capital in order to continue to advance NC318, NC410 and &#10; future product candidates through preclinical studies, clinical trials,  &#10; regulatory approval and commercialization.',\n",

We believe that our &#10; programs, platforms, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources &#10; provide us with competitive advantages, but we also face competition from &#10; pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental &#10; agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Our &#10; competitors include larger and better funded biopharmaceutical, biotechnology &#10; and therapeutics companies, including companies focused on cancer &#10; immunotherapies, such as Amgen, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb &#10; Company, or BMS, Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Merck & Co., Inc., &#10; Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd and Sanofi S.A. Moreover, we may &#10; also compete with smaller or earlier-stage companies, universities and other &#10; research institutions that have developed, are developing or may be developing &#10; current and future cancer therapeutics. &#10;  &#10; Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete &#10; with a range of therapies that are currently approved and any new therapies that &#10; may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our &#10; ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, &#10; safety and convenience of our products. Currently marketed oncology drugs and &#10; therapeutics range from traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, to &#10; antibody-drug conjugates, such as Genentech Inc.'s Kadcyla, to immune checkpoint &#10; inhibitors targeting CTLA-4, such as BMS' Yervoy, and PD-1/PD-L1, such as BMS'  &#10; Opdivo, Merck & Co.'s Keytruda and Genentech's Tecentriq, to T cell-engager  &#10; immunotherapies, such as Amgen's Blincyto. In addition to these marketed  &#10; therapies, numerous compounds are in clinical development for the potential  &#10; treatment of cancer. &#10;  &#10; The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors &#10; will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. &#10; Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their &#10; products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result &#10; in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to &#10; enter the market.\",\n",

Our capabilities, which include, but are not limited to: metal &#10; fabrication, metal stamping, tube bending and forming, robotic part forming, &#10; robotic welding, resistance welding, five-axis tube and fiber laser cutting and &#10; custom coatings, including high heat and chemical agent resistant coating, or &#10; CARC, painting, are used in a variety of applications and represent the building &#10; blocks of what we produce. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; Our key customers have globally recognized brands and demand the highest product &#10; quality and expertise. Over our nearly 75-year history, we have developed &#10; capabilities and provide solutions that result in customer loyalty and &#10; long-standing relationships, which we call “Experience You Can Trust.” We have a &#10; diverse and market-leading customer base that serves broad end markets &#10; representing favorable near- and long-term growth prospects for us. We have a &#10; track record of growth and are well-positioned to increase our market share and &#10; benefit from growth in customer demand as well as consolidate demand across the &#10; end markets that we serve. To help pursue our strategic mission, we have more &#10; than 3,100 employees who are tactically aligned around our core values and will &#10; continue to participate in our employee ownership culture. We are led by an &#10; experienced management team that has contributed to our growth by establishing &#10; deep and long-standing relationships with key customers, and has worked to &#10; expand the customer base both organically and through strategic acquisitions. &#10;  &#10; We maintain an established base of long-standing customers comprised of leading, &#10; blue-chip OEM manufacturers across the United States. Our broad capabilities &#10; offering and track record of producing the highest quality solutions have &#10; allowed us to establish, and subsequently deepen, relationships with additional &#10; products and platforms over time. For example, our more than 40 year &#10; relationship with Deere & Company, which we sometimes refer to as John Deere, &#10; began with a small order of simple stamped parts for a farm tractor in its &#10; agricultural segment that expanded over time and represented 2018 pro forma &#10; sales in excess of $90.0 million across five market segments, representing over &#10; 60 model platforms. We have also been successful in winning customers and &#10; rapidly expanding relationships with high-growth customers by utilizing our &#10; diversified “one-stop” offering. For instance, our relationship with Volvo Truck &#10; began with fuel tanks and has expanded over the last six years to include &#10; exhaust tubing, new sleeper cab and chassis fabrications and air tanks. Through &#10; the expansion of multiple fabricated components from multiple facilities, we &#10; have been able to deepen our relationship with this customer and solidify our &#10; position as an important strategic sourcing partner. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We serve customers through 21 strategically located U.S. facilities across eight &#10; states, with almost three million square feet of manufacturing capacity. Our &#10; expansive footprint enables us to service and maintain strong relationships with &#10; existing key customers across the United States with a “local” presence, as well &#10; as target new customer opportunities. We have a proven track record of improving &#10; financial results by thoroughly understanding our capabilities and the markets &#10; we serve, and aligning our people and resources to optimize results. Coupled &#10; with our focus on market alignment and execution, we constantly strive to &#10; improve and refine capabilities and capacities. In addition, the ongoing &#10; investment in flexible, re-deployable automation allows us to expand output &#10; while reducing cost and improving quality, productivity and consistency for &#10; margin enhancement and market leading competitiveness. Through this continuum of &#10; activities, we have generated approximately $34.3 million in improved results &#10; from the beginning of 2014 through December 31, 2018. &#10;  &#10; Our leading market position, embedded customer relationships with leading OEMs, &#10; unique value proposition and proven acquisition strategy has allowed us to &#10; achieve attractive financial performance and has positioned us for further &#10; growth. Our historical financial success is a function of our engineering &#10; expertise, extensive manufacturing capabilities, limited commodity exposure, &#10; investment in automation and embedded relationships with the contractual ability &#10; to pass input costs through prices. We believe we are poised to grow through &#10; economic cycles due to our: &#10;  &#10; . market positioning and reputation; &#10;  &#10; . product breadth; &#10;  &#10; . flexible and re-deployable capital investment in automation and process    &#10;   capabilities; and                                                          &#10;  &#10; . our geographic, end market and product diversification. &#10;  &#10; Our diversified profile today best positions us for stability and leading market &#10; performance through all phases of an economic cycle. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We are a Wisconsin corporation and commenced operations in 1945.

Our new understanding of &#10; the P. gingivalis brain infection and associated gingipain production, which we &#10; have observed to cause Alzheimer’s pathology in animal models, provides a new &#10; opportunity for successful upstream treatment of all aspects of Alzheimer’s &#10; disease pathology. Significant evidence in the last decade has shown that &#10; neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, are linked to a &#10; dysfunctional immune system. Furthermore, the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease &#10; has been shown in studies to be consistent with that of infection, including, &#10; for example, the pathological presence of amyloid beta, which recently has been &#10; characterized as an antimicrobial peptide produced in response to infection. &#10;  &#10; In preclinical mouse models, we and others have demonstrated that P. gingivalis &#10; is capable of accessing the brain and that its presence causes characteristic &#10; pathology observed in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients, including amyloid beta &#10; production, inflammation and neurodegeneration. P. gingivalis and gingipains  &#10; have been observed in the brains of greater than 90% of more than 100  &#10; Alzheimer’s patients across multiple studies conducted by our team both  &#10; independently and in collaboration with academic institutions. &#10;  &#10; COR388 for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease &#10;  &#10; COR388 is the first and only selective inhibitor of gingipain activity being &#10; investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. COR388 &#10; is designed to target an upstream driver of multiple Alzheimer’s pathological &#10; pathways, including amyloid beta production, inflammation and neurodegeneration, &#10; in contrast to mechanisms of action targeting downstream effects, such as &#10; amyloid plaques and tau tangles, which have been largely unsuccessful in &#10; clinical trials to date. Accordingly, we believe COR388 could represent a &#10; disease-modifying therapy for the chronic treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. &#10;  &#10; Our Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trials enrolled a total of 67 subjects, &#10; including nine patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. In these &#10; placebo-controlled trials, COR388 was well-tolerated with no concerning safety &#10; signals. In the Alzheimer’s patients treated with COR388 for 28 days, we found &#10; changes in a number of pharmacodynamic biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s &#10; disease, including RANTES, an inflammatory marker, and Apolipoprotein protein E, &#10; or ApoE, a target for gingipains. For example, fragments of ApoE in the cerebral &#10; spinal fluid, or CSF, were reduced compared to placebo, and blood levels of &#10; RANTES were significantly reduced. In addition, data from the Alzheimer’s &#10; patients treated with COR388 in our Phase 1b clinical trial showed improvements &#10; across several exploratory cognitive tests, such as Mean Mini-Mental State Exam, &#10; Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery composite and Winterlight &#10; speech-based cognitive assessment. These improvements in cognitive tests should &#10; be interpreted with caution because they were not all statistically significant. &#10; We identified bacterial DNA from P. gingivalis in the CSF of all nine &#10; Alzheimer’s patients, and this finding is supported by additional data from &#10; larger studies conducted by our team both independently and in collaboration &#10; with academic institutions. Moreover, we observed that COR388 successfully &#10; penetrated the blood-brain barrier. In addition, in our preclinical studies, we &#10; observed that COR388 reduced bacterial load in the brain, reduced amyloid beta &#10; levels, protected neurons and reduced markers of neuroinflammation. &#10;  &#10; We believe that the development of this compound represents a new paradigm for &#10; potential disease modification in Alzheimer’s disease, based on our published &#10; and unpublished data, as well as a large body of third-party research. We plan &#10; to enroll approximately 570 mild to moderate Alzheimer’s patients in our Phase &#10; 2/3 GAIN trial, or GingipAIN inhibitor for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease &#10; trial, to evaluate safety and efficacy after one year of treatment as measured &#10; on key endpoints that have previously supported regulatory approval of drugs for &#10; Alzheimer’s disease, including the Alzheimer’s disease Assessment &#10; Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11, or ADAS-Cog11. We maintain rights to COR388 and &#10; hold issued U.S. patents providing composition of matter coverage through 2035 &#10; and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, which, if issued, could extend &#10; coverage. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We were incorporated in Delaware on June 20, 2012.

We cannot &#10; guarantee that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms &#10; or at all. &#10;  &#10; This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our &#10; intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date &#10; of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses &#10; for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or the &#10; amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. &#10;  &#10; The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of our Phase &#10; 2/3 GAIN trial and research and development activities may vary significantly &#10; depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our development &#10; efforts, the status of and results from any preclinical or clinical trials we &#10; may commence in the future, our ability to take advantage of expedited programs &#10; or to obtain regulatory approval for any other drug candidates we may identify &#10; and pursue, the timing and costs associated with the manufacture and supply of &#10; any other drug candidates we may identify and pursue for clinical development or &#10; commercialization, and any unforeseen cash needs.

       "   'businessDescription': 'We are a biotechnology company pioneering the research and development of novel &#10; multifactorial interventions to support health and address dysregulated  &#10; metabolism across a broad spectrum of consumers and patients who have limited &#10; options. Our AXA Candidates are generated from our proprietary, human-focused &#10; AXA Development Platform and harness the power of endogenous metabolic &#10; modulators, or EMMs, a broad family of molecules that fundamentally impact and &#10; regulate human metabolism. &#10;  &#10; Using our AXA Development Platform, we have rapidly generated a pipeline of AXA &#10; Candidates that are novel compositions of EMMs engineered in distinct ratios and &#10; designed to target and maximize the fundamental role that EMMs play in  &#10; regulating multiple metabolic functions. Our AXA Candidates are administered &#10; orally and anchored by amino acids, which have a history of safe use as food. As &#10; such, we expect our AXA Candidates may also be combinable with other modalities. &#10; We believe our current dataset supports the potential of our AXA Candidates to &#10; safely modulate the metabolic pathways they target. These features may make them &#10; an attractive development opportunity with significant commercial potential. &#10;  &#10; In 2018, we completed three Non-IND, IRB-Approved Clinical Studies. In all three &#10; studies, our AXA Candidates were generally found to be well tolerated, and we  &#10; generated positive normal structure and function data indicating potential  &#10; metabolic modulation. We believe generating this rich human dataset at this &#10; early stage of development (i) eliminates the translational uncertainty &#10; associated with transitioning from animal studies to human studies, (ii) enables &#10; us to make high-insight, capital-efficient development decisions and  &#10; (iii) potentially increases the probability of success for these AXA Candidates. &#10; For AXA Candidates we decide to develop under an IND, we will discuss with the  &#10; FDA our ability to use data generated from our Non-IND, IRB-Approved Clinical  &#10; Studies to begin Phase II or potential registrational Clinical Trials. &#10;  &#10; On March 6, 2019, we had a face-to-face pre-IND meeting with the FDA for  &#10; AXA1665, our lead AXA Candidate, during which we discussed clinical endpoints, &#10; assessment tools and other matters relating to a potential IND-opening Clinical &#10; Trial for AXA1665 in hepatic encephalopathy, or HE. After meeting with the FDA, &#10; we made a decision to pursue a drug development path for AXA1665. Under the &#10; planned IND, the initial indication would be for the treatment of HE, with time &#10; to breakthrough episode of overt HE event as the primary endpoint and key &#10; secondary muscle-related endpoints. We anticipate interacting with the FDA again &#10; prior to a formal IND submission for AXA1665. We anticipate initiating a &#10; Clinical Trial in the second half of 2020 for AXA1665 that we believe could &#10; potentially serve as a registrational (pivotal) trial to support the submission &#10; of a New Drug Application, or NDA. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We were founded in 2008 by Flagship Labs, the institutional innovation foundry  &#10; of Flagship Pioneering. A team comprising innovators and entrepreneurs Dr. David &#10; Berry, Dr. Geoffrey von Maltzahn and Dr. Noubar Afeyan started exploring the  &#10; potential medical applications of diverse, orally-consumed proteins. The work &#10; of this team led to the understanding that specific amino acid combinations at  &#10; different ratios have the potential to drive profound biological effects in both &#10; health and disease by impactingdysregulated metabolic pathways and  &#10; multi-compartmental biology. With this transformational new approach, we are  &#10; harnessing the potential for orally-administered EMM compositions to drive  &#10; cellularbiology in a specific and reproducible manner with the goal of  &#10; delivering safe interventions for patients or consumers.  &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We were incorporated in August 2008 under the laws of the state of Delaware  &#10; under the name Newco LS16, Inc.

We do not expect that a change in the &#10; initial public offering price or the number of shares by these amounts would &#10; have a material effect on our uses of the proceeds from this offering, although &#10; it may accelerate the time at which we will need to seek additional capital. &#10;  &#10; We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with &#10; our cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2019, as follows: &#10;  &#10; • approximately $90.0 million to advance our current liver (AXA1665, AXA1125 and &#10;   AXA1957) and other programs, including through additional Non-IND,  &#10;   IRB-Approved Clinical Studies, potential IND filing(s) and the ensuing &#10;   Clinical Trials, including our planned IND filing and Clinical Trial for &#10;   AXA1665, and infrastructure to support our pipeline; &#10;  &#10; • approximately $30.0 million to advance our AXA Development Platform discovery &#10;   efforts, intellectual property and associated infrastructure; and &#10;   &#10; • the remainder, if any, for working capital and other general corporate  &#10;   purposes. &#10;  &#10; As of March 31, 2019, we had $66.7 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, &#10; based on preliminary unaudited information and management estimates for the  &#10; three months ended March 31, 2019. Based on our current plans, we believe our  &#10; cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2019, together with the net proceeds &#10; from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and  &#10; capital expenditure requirements through the second quarter of 2021. With our &#10; cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2019 and the net proceeds of this  &#10; offering, we expect to be able to complete ongoing and planned Non-IND &#10; IRB-Approved Clinical Studies numbered AXA1665-002, AXA1125-003, AXA1957-002 and &#10; AXA4010-001; and file an IND for a Phase IIb/III AXA1665 Clinical Trial in HE, &#10; including if it is a registrational study. We have based these estimates on &#10; assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available &#10; capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In any event, we will require &#10; additional funding to be able to complete any Clinical Trial in HE, and we do &#10; not yet have any committed source of funding for this Clinical Trial. We may &#10; satisfy our future cash needs through the sale of equity securities, debt &#10; financings, working capital lines of credit, corporate collaborations or license &#10; agreements, grant funding, interest income earned on invested cash balances, or &#10; a combination of one or more of these sources. &#10;  &#10; We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds &#10; to be received upon the completion of this offering. Due to uncertainties  &#10; inherent in the development process, it is difficult to estimate the exact &#10; amounts of the net proceeds that will be used for any particular purpose. We may &#10; use our existing cash, cash equivalents and the future payments, if any,  &#10; generated from any future collaboration agreements to fund our operations, &#10; either of which may alter the amount of net proceeds used for a particular &#10; purpose. In addition, the amount, allocation and timing of our actual  &#10; expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of our &#10; research and development efforts, the timing and success of our Non-IND,  &#10; IRB-Approved Clinical Studies and Clinical Trials and the timing of regulatory &#10; submissions. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds. &#10;  &#10; Pending their uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in &#10; short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments, certificates of &#10; deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.',\n",

The &#10; primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of etripamil &#10; or any other product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval &#10; include efficacy, safety, tolerability, dosing convenience, price, coverage and &#10; reimbursement. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially &#10; greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly &#10; greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as &#10; well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the &#10; United States and in foreign countries. &#10;  &#10; Our current and potential future competitors may also have significantly more &#10; experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers &#10; and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result &#10; in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our &#10; competitors. &#10;  &#10; Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining &#10; regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance &#10; of their drugs. It is also possible that a competitor may develop a cure or more &#10; effective treatment method for the diseases we are targeting, which could render &#10; our current or future product candidates non-competitive or obsolete, or reduce &#10; the demand for our product candidates before we can recover our development and &#10; commercialization expenses. &#10;  &#10; We are not aware of any approved drug or drug in clinical development for a &#10; patient self-administered treatment to terminate PSVT episodes. InCarda &#10; Therapeutics, Inc., or InCarda, is developing InRhythm, an inhaled version of &#10; flecainide, in preclinical development. To our knowledge, there are no other &#10; treatments in development for acute episodic treatment of PSVT. In the acute &#10; setting, IV treatments of generic drugs such as adenosine, verapamil and &#10; diltiazem, are routinely given. Additionally, some practitioners prescribe oral &#10; medications, such as calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and &#10; anti-arrhythmics to be taken at the onset of an episode. However, these &#10; interventions are not acutely effective. &#10;  &#10; For atrial fibrillation, there are a number of marketed generic anti-arrhythmic &#10; drugs that are used for chronic and/or acute rate control, such as metoprolol, &#10; propranolol, esmolol, pindolol, atenolol, nadolol, verapamil and diltiazem. &#10; There are also several drugs under development for atrial fibrillation, &#10; including: Ranexa (ranolazine), a sodium channel blocker in Phase 2 (ex-U.S.) &#10; from Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead; Gencaro (bucindolol hydrochloride), a &#10; beta blocker in Phase 2 from ARCA biopharma, Inc.. &#10;  &#10; For acute relief of angina symptoms, approved drugs include short-acting &#10; nitrates such as nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate, and pentaerythritol. We &#10; are not aware of any approved drug or drug in clinical development for &#10; rapid-onset, short-acting treatment for coronary spasm.',\n",

    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business &#10;     combination. &#10;   &#10; (2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans &#10;     from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. These  &#10;     loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $750,000 of &#10;     offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering  &#10;     expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering  &#10;     expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be  &#10;     used for post-closing working capital expenses. &#10;   &#10; (3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of  &#10;     the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the  &#10;     completion of our initial business combination, up to $12,250,000, which  &#10;     constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $14,087,500 if &#10;     the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid  &#10;     to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining &#10;     funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders,  &#10;     will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the  &#10;     purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business &#10;     combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of &#10;     principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our  &#10;     initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or  &#10;     for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest  &#10;     accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. &#10;   &#10; (4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  &#10;     of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, &#10;     we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current  &#10;     estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial  &#10;     business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business  &#10;     combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a  &#10;     specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional &#10;     expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special &#10;     legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we &#10;     may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due &#10;     diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, &#10;     other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, &#10;     which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any  &#10;     specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The &#10;     amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the &#10;     trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only &#10;     in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less &#10;     or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under  &#10;     the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government  &#10;     treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account &#10;     will be approximately $5,250,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of &#10;     1.5% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. &#10;   &#10; (5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our  &#10;     initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment &#10;     fees for financing. &#10;   &#10; Nasdaq rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering &#10; and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust account. &#10; Of the $358.5 million in gross proceeds we receive from this offering and the &#10; sale of the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or &#10; $412.05 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, &#10; $350 million ($10.00 per unit), or $402.5 million if the underwriters’ &#10; over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited &#10; into a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as &#10; trustee, after deducting $7 million in underwriting discounts and commissions &#10; payable upon the closing of this offering (or $8.05 million if the underwriters’ &#10; over-allotment option is exercised in full) and an aggregate of $1.5 million to &#10; pay expenses in connection with the closing of this offering and for working &#10; capital following this offering. The proceeds held in the trust account will be &#10; invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or &#10; less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under &#10; the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury &#10; obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be &#10; approximately $5,250,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per year; &#10; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. We expect that the &#10; interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay income taxes. We &#10; will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the &#10; trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to fund our working capital &#10; requirements (subject to an annual limit of  $250,000) and/or to pay our taxes, &#10; until the earliest of  (i) the completion of our initial business combination, &#10; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our &#10; initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, &#10; subject to applicable law, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares &#10; properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment &#10; to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance &#10; or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares &#10; in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our  &#10; public shares if we have not consummated our initial business combination within &#10; 24 months from the closing of this offering. &#10;  &#10; The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay &#10; the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial &#10; business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using &#10; equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust &#10; account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial &#10; business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the &#10; trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or &#10; expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of &#10; principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial &#10; business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working &#10; capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or &#10; through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial &#10; business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may &#10; enter into following consummation of this offering. However, our amended and &#10; restated certificate of incorporation provides that, following this offering and &#10; prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will be &#10; prohibited from issuing additional securities that would entitle the holders &#10; thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with &#10; our public shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an &#10; amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (x) extend &#10; the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months from the &#10; closing of this offering or (y) amend the foregoing provisions. &#10;  &#10; We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs &#10; and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the &#10; fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in &#10; connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due &#10; diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business &#10; combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or &#10; other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. &#10; However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and &#10; negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to &#10; do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability &#10; and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek &#10; additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or &#10; additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any &#10; of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance &#10; funds to, or invest in, us. &#10;  &#10; We will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and &#10; administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount &#10; not to exceed $15,000 per month in the event such space and/or services are &#10; utilized and we do not pay a third party directly for such services. Upon &#10; completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease &#10; paying these monthly fees. &#10;  &#10; Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to &#10; $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans &#10; are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, &#10; 2019 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing &#10; of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been &#10; allocated to the payment of offering expenses. &#10;  &#10; In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an &#10; intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our &#10; sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, &#10; loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business &#10; combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. Otherwise, such loans would be &#10; repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our &#10; initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working &#10; capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no &#10; proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up &#10; to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post &#10; business combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the &#10; lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. &#10; Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been &#10; determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to &#10; the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek  &#10; loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we  &#10; do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a  &#10; waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.',\n",
       "   'competition': 'In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial &#10; business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a &#10; business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition &#10; companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies &#10; and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities &#10; are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting &#10; business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these &#10; competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than &#10; us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our &#10; available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an &#10; advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our &#10; obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise &#10; their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial &#10; business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they &#10; potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. &#10; Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in &#10; successfully negotiating an initial business combination.',\n",

Our products are built with the expertise that allows us to &#10;   set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide platform users with &#10;   a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and  &#10;   functionality, and deliver safety and trust.                           &#10;  &#10; Our Personal Mobility, Uber Eats, and Uber Freight platform offerings each &#10; address large, fragmented markets. &#10;  &#10; Personal Mobility &#10;  &#10; Our Personal Mobility offering includes Ridesharing and New Mobility. &#10; Ridesharing refers to products that connect consumers with Drivers who provide &#10; rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, &#10; minibuses, or taxis. New Mobility refers to products that provide consumers with &#10; access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and &#10; e-scooters. We aim to provide everyone, everywhere on our platform with access &#10; to a safe, reliable, affordable, and convenient trip within a few minutes of &#10; tapping a button. In the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the average wait time &#10; for a rider to be picked up by a Driver was five minutes. In addition to &#10; powering movement for riders, our platform powers opportunity for Drivers, &#10; fueling the future of independent work by providing Drivers with a reliable and &#10; flexible way to earn money. &#10;  &#10; We are committed to providing consumers with access to the best personal &#10; mobility options to meet their needs. We are investing in new modes of &#10; transportation that enable us to address a wider range of consumer use cases and &#10; represent a significant opportunity to bring additional trips onto our platform. &#10; For example, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, trips of less &#10; than three miles accounted for 46% of all U.S. vehicle trips in 2017. We believe &#10; that dockless e-bikes and e-scooters address many of these use cases and will &#10; replace a portion of these vehicle trips over time, particularly in urban &#10; environments that suffer from substantial traffic during peak commuting hours. &#10;  &#10; The rapid growth and scale of our Ridesharing products, which to date have &#10; accounted for virtually all of our Personal Mobility offering, demonstrates the &#10; size of our opportunity: &#10;  &#10; • Revenue derived from our Ridesharing products grew from $3.5 billion in 2016 &#10;   to $9.2 billion in 2018.                                              &#10;  &#10; • Gross Bookings derived from our Ridesharing products grew from $18.8 billion &#10;   in 2016 to $41.5 billion in 2018.                                  &#10;  &#10; • Consumers traveled approximately 26 billion miles on our platform in 2018. &#10;  &#10; We believe that Personal Mobility represents a vast, rapidly growing, and &#10; underpenetrated market opportunity. We operate our Personal Mobility offering in &#10; 63 countries with an aggregate population of 4.1 billion people. Through our &#10; Personal Mobility offering, we estimate that our platform served 2% of the &#10; population in these countries based on MAPCs in the quarter ended December 31, &#10; 2018. We estimate that people traveled 4.7 trillion vehicle miles in trips under &#10; 30 miles in these countries in 2018, of which the approximately 26 billion miles &#10; traveled on our platform represent less than 1% penetration. &#10;  &#10; We believe that our Personal Mobility market share and ridesharing category &#10; position are key indicators of our progress towards our massive market &#10; opportunity. We calculate our Personal Mobility market share in a given region &#10; by dividing our Personal Mobility miles traveled by our estimates of the &#10; addressable market in miles traveled in the region. We estimate the size of the &#10; addressable market by multiplying the number of passenger cars in each country &#10; by our country-level estimates of miles traveled per car. Our estimates also &#10; include an estimated 4.4 trillion public transportation miles, which we allocate &#10; to regions based on their share of the population in our addressable market.  &#10; Based on this estimate, our Personal Mobility market share is less than 1% in &#10; every major region of the world where we operate. &#10;  &#10; We calculate our ridesharing category position within a given region by dividing &#10; our Ridesharing Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross &#10; Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. &#10; Based on these estimates, we have a leading ridesharing category position in &#10; every major region of the world where we operate, as shown in the graphic below. &#10; We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates and &#10; intend to maintain our interests in these minority-owned affiliates to &#10; participate in the expected growth of ridesharing and other modes of personal &#10; mobility in the regions where they operate. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; Uber Eats &#10;  &#10; Our Uber Eats offering allows consumers to search for and discover local &#10; restaurants, order a meal at the touch of a button, and have the meal delivered &#10; reliably and quickly. We launched our Uber Eats app just over three years ago, &#10; and we believe that Uber Eats has grown to be the largest meal delivery platform &#10; in the world outside of China based on Gross Bookings. We believe that our scale &#10; enables the average delivery time for Uber Eats to be faster than the average &#10; delivery time for our competitors. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the &#10; average delivery time was approximately 30 minutes. We believe that Uber Eats &#10; not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. &#10; For example, Uber Eats enables Ridesharing Drivers to increase their utilization &#10; and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak &#10; Ridesharing times. Uber Eats also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people &#10; who are not Ridesharing Drivers or who do not have access to &#10; Ridesharing-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform. In addition to &#10; benefiting Drivers and consumers, Uber Eats provides restaurants with an instant &#10; mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates &#10; incremental demand and improves margins for restaurants by enabling them to &#10; serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses. &#10; Of the 91 million MAPCs on our platform, over 15 million received a meal using &#10; Uber Eats in the quarter ended December 31, 2018, tapping into our network of &#10; more than 220,000 restaurants in over 500 cities globally. &#10;  &#10; In connection with our transactions with Grab and Yandex, we contributed our &#10; meal delivery offerings in Southeast Asia and Russia/CIS to Grab and to our &#10; Yandex.Taxi joint venture, respectively, including our partnerships with certain &#10; significant global restaurant chains with operations in those markets. We expect &#10; to benefit from continued growth of the meal delivery industry in the regions &#10; where our minority-owned affiliates operate.   &#10;  &#10; Uber Freight &#10;  &#10; We believe that Uber Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Uber &#10; Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience &#10; revolutionizing industries to create a transparent, on-demand marketplace that &#10; seamlessly connects shippers and carriers. &#10;  &#10; The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can &#10; take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for &#10; shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Uber &#10; Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an &#10; on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. &#10; Uber Freight connects carriers with the most appropriate shipments available on &#10; our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to &#10; book a shipment with the touch of a button. &#10;  &#10; We serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global &#10; enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, &#10; secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in &#10; real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors &#10; represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage &#10; providers. Since Uber Freight’s public launch in the United States in May 2017, &#10; we have contracted with over 36,000 carriers that in aggregate have more than &#10; 400,000 drivers and have served over 1,000 shippers, including global &#10; enterprises such as Anheuser-Busch InBev, Niagara, Land O’Lakes, and &#10; Colgate-Palmolive. Uber Freight has grown to $125 million in revenue for the &#10; quarter ended December 31, 2018. &#10;  &#10; In March 2019, we announced the expansion of our Uber Freight offering into &#10; Europe. Although Europe’s freight market is one of the largest and most &#10; sophisticated in the world, we believe that European shippers and carriers &#10; experience many of the same pain points in their current operations as U.S. &#10; shippers and carriers. &#10;  &#10; Platform Synergies &#10;  &#10; We intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will &#10; further strengthen our platform and existing offerings and fuel multiple &#10; virtuous cycles of growth. &#10;  &#10; We can rapidly launch and scale platform products and offerings by leveraging &#10; our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product &#10; expertise. Furthermore, each new product adds nodes to our network and &#10; strengthens these shared capabilities, enabling us to launch and invest in &#10; additional products more efficiently. For example, Uber Eats is used by many of &#10; the same consumers who use our Ridesharing products, is built on our existing &#10; technology stack, and has grown by leveraging many of the same regional &#10; operations teams that built our Ridesharing products. Similarly, in cities where &#10; we already operate, we can more efficiently launch other products and offerings, &#10; such as dockless e-bikes and e-scooters, by leveraging our existing network of &#10; Drivers and consumers and regional on-the-ground operations teams. As evidence &#10; of the power of our platform, Uber Eats grew to $2.6 billion in Gross Bookings &#10; for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, nearly three years following the launch &#10; of the Uber Eats app, which we believe makes our Uber Eats offering the largest &#10; meal delivery platform in the world outside of China. In addition, each new &#10; product or offering enables us to invest more efficiently because we share &#10; innovations and investments across our platform offerings. These synergies &#10; effectively lower our costs and allow us to invest in a scalable way that &#10; becomes increasingly efficient as we grow with each new product or offering. &#10;  &#10; Each platform offering also increases the value of our platform to platform &#10; users, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with &#10; existing platform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and &#10; liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. &#10; For example, Uber Eats attracts new consumers to our network – in the quarter &#10; ended December 31, 2018, 50% of first-time Uber Eats consumers were new to our &#10; platform. Additionally, in the quarter ended December 31, 2018, consumers who &#10; used both Personal Mobility and Uber Eats had 11.5 Trips per month on average, &#10; compared to 4.9 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single &#10; offering in cities where both Personal Mobility and Uber Eats were offered. &#10; Similarly, having multiple offerings increases our engagement with Drivers. For &#10; example, with Uber Eats, Ridesharing Drivers can access additional demand for &#10; trips during non-peak Ridesharing times to increase their utilization and &#10; earnings. We believe that these trends will continue as we further expand Uber &#10; Eats from over 500 cities into nearly 700 cities where we already offer Personal &#10; Mobility. &#10;  &#10; The strength of our leading platform is demonstrated by our performance: &#10;  &#10; • There were 91 million MAPCs for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. &#10;  &#10; • There were 1.5 billion Trips on our platform for the quarter ended December &#10;   31, 2018.                                                         &#10;  &#10; • There were 3.9 million Drivers on our platform for the quarter ended December &#10;   31, 2018.                                                         &#10;  &#10; • Drivers have earned over $78.2 billion on our platform since 2015, as well as &#10;   $1.2 billion in tips since we introduced in-app tipping for Drivers in July &#10;   2017, in each case through December 31, 2018.                         &#10;  &#10; • We had a 9% Core Platform Contribution Margin in 2018.                &#10;  &#10; In 2018, Gross Bookings grew to $49.8 billion, up 45% from $34.4 billion in &#10; 2017. Over the same period, revenue reached $11.3 billion, up 42% from $7.9 &#10; billion in the prior year. Core Platform Adjusted Net Revenue was $9.9 billion &#10; in 2018, up 39% from $7.1 billion in 2017. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We were founded in 2009 and incorporated as Ubercab, Inc., a Delaware  &#10; corporation, in July 2010.

We will not receive proceeds from the sale of common stock in this &#10; offering by the selling stockholders. &#10;  &#10; Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of &#10; $47.00 per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this &#10; offering by approximately $178.2 million, assuming the number of shares of &#10; common stock offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, &#10; remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions &#10; and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, each increase &#10; (decrease) of 1.0 million shares in the number of shares of common stock offered &#10; by us would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by &#10; approximately $46.5 million, based on the assumed initial public offering price &#10; of $47.00 per share remains the same and after deducting the underwriting &#10; discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. &#10;  &#10; The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and &#10; financial flexibility and to create a public market for our common stock. &#10;  &#10; We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for general &#10; corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and capital &#10; expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or make &#10; investments in businesses, products, offerings, and technologies, although we do &#10; not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or investments &#10; at this time. &#10;  &#10; We expect to use some of the net proceeds from this offering to satisfy a &#10; portion of the anticipated tax withholding and remittance obligations related to &#10; the settlement of our outstanding RSUs that will vest in connection with this &#10; offering. Based on 76.1 million RSUs outstanding for which the service condition &#10; has been met as of May 1, 2019, and based on the assumed initial public offering &#10; price of $47.00 per share, we estimate that these tax withholding obligations on &#10; the initial settlement date would be approximately $1.4 billion in the &#10; aggregate. Each $1.00 increase in the price of our common stock at the time of &#10; settlement from the assumed initial public offering price of $47.00 per share, &#10; assuming no change in the applicable tax rates, would increase the amount we &#10; would be required to pay to satisfy these obligations by approximately &#10; $29.7 million. Each $1.00 decrease in the price of our common stock at the time &#10; of settlement from the assumed initial public offering price of $47.00 per &#10; share, assuming no change to the applicable tax rates, would decrease the amount &#10; we would be required to pay to satisfy these obligations by approximately &#10; $29.7 million. &#10;  &#10; The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions &#10; based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with &#10; certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the &#10; amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly, &#10; our management will have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds of this &#10; offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many &#10; factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our &#10; business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this &#10; offering in a variety of capital-preservation investments, including short- and &#10; intermediate-term investments, interest-bearing investments, investment-grade &#10; securities, government securities, and money market funds.',\n",
       "   'competition': 'We face competition in each of our offerings, including: &#10;  &#10; • Personal Mobility. Our Personal Mobility offering competes with personal   &#10;   vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger  &#10;   miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, &#10;   including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, and livery services. In &#10;   addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Personal &#10;   Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel  &#10;   option in many cities. In Ridesharing, we compete with companies, including &#10;   certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including &#10;   Lyft, OLA, Careem, Didi, Taxify, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Our New &#10;   Mobility products compete for riders in the bike and scooter space, including &#10;   Motivate (an affiliate of Lyft), Lime, Bird, and Skip. We also compete with &#10;   OEMs and other technology companies in the development of autonomous vehicle &#10;   technologies and the deployment of autonomous vehicles, including Waymo, &#10;   Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox, Aptiv, May Mobility, Pronto.ai, Aurora, &#10;   and Nuro, whose offerings may prove more effective than our autonomous vehicle &#10;   technologies. Waymo has already introduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet &#10;   of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that other of our competitors &#10;   could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will. &#10;  &#10; • Uber Eats. Our Uber Eats offering competes with numerous companies in the meal &#10;   delivery space in various regions for Drivers, consumers, and restaurants, &#10;   including GrubHub, DoorDash, Deliveroo, Swiggy, Postmates, Zomato, Delivery &#10;   Hero, Just Eat, Takeaway.com, and Amazon. Our Uber Eats offering also competes &#10;   with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and &#10;   traditional grocers.                        &#10;  &#10; • Uber Freight. Our Uber Freight offering competes with global and North  &#10;   American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO &#10;   Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT &#10;   Trucking.                                                             &#10;  &#10; We are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned &#10; affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including in China &#10; through August 2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, and Southeast Asia &#10; through the longer of March 2023 or one year after we dispose of all interests &#10; in Grab, while none of our minority-owned affiliates are restricted from &#10; competing with us anywhere in the world. &#10;  &#10; In general, the bases upon which we compete include: &#10;  &#10; • Consumers. We compete to attract, engage, and retain consumers in Personal &#10;   Mobility and Uber Eats. In Personal Mobility, we believe that our ability to &#10;   compete effectively for consumers depends on many factors, including the wait &#10;   time for a ride, fare, ease of payment, reliability of ETA, ability to give &#10;   feedback, availability of dockless e-bikes or e-scooters and receive support, &#10;   and experience of a ride as well as our reputation and the strength of our &#10;   brand. In Uber Eats, we additionally compete on the basis of restaurant &#10;   selection, delivery prices, and reliability of delivery. We also compete for &#10;   shippers in Uber Freight.                    &#10;  &#10; • Drivers and carriers. We seek to attract and retain Drivers in Ridesharing and &#10;   Uber Eats and carriers in Uber Freight. We believe that Drivers and carriers &#10;   can earn more per hour on our platform than other Ridesharing, meal delivery, &#10;   and freight alternatives, given consumer demand, our data, and our marketplace &#10;   liquidity advantages. We recently introduced a Driver rewards program, Uber &#10;   Pro, in beta mode in eight cities in the United States to incentivize them to &#10;   drive with Uber and provide Drivers with the opportunity to receive discounts &#10;   on vehicle maintenance and gas. We are committed to giving Drivers and &#10;   carriers resources to thrive on our platform.               &#10;  &#10; • Network liquidity. We compete to achieve network liquidity through attracting &#10;   Drivers and consumers, and by providing consumers with lower prices to scale &#10;   our platform. At scale, our platform offers consumers lower wait times, lower &#10;   fares, and quicker delivery, and Drivers can earn a higher wage per hour, a &#10;   virtuous cycle that creates a growing liquidity network effect in a city.',\n",

Upon completion of this &#10; offering and the related formation transactions, Mr. Spodek will own &#10; approximately 29.0% of the fully diluted equity interests in our company. &#10;  &#10; The USPS is an independent agency of the executive branch of the U.S. federal &#10; government that generated $70.6 billion of revenue for its fiscal year ended &#10; September 30, 2018. Article I, Section 8, Clause 7 of the United States &#10; Constitution empowers Congress “[t]o establish Post Offices and post Roads,” &#10; making the USPS one of the few federal agencies explicitly authorized by the &#10; United States Constitution. The USPS is federally required to provide universal &#10; service to all residents of the United States and its territories, including &#10; rural and isolated areas, and has a monopoly on mail delivery and delivery to &#10; residential and business mailboxes, with delivery to most homes and businesses &#10; six days per week. The USPS’s ability to deliver 493 million pieces of mail to &#10; an estimated 159 million delivery points as of September 30, 2018 is driven by a &#10; sophisticated logistics infrastructure of post offices, processing and &#10; distribution centers and annexes. As of September 30, 2018, the USPS managed a &#10; network of over 31,000 properties of which over 23,000 were owned by private &#10; owners and leased to the USPS. We believe that this network of properties is a &#10; critical element of the nation’s logistics infrastructure that facilitates cost &#10; effective and efficient “last mile” delivery solutions for the nation’s largest &#10; e-commerce providers including Amazon, FedEx and UPS. &#10;  &#10; In December 2018, a presidential task force issued a report, which we refer to &#10; as the Task Force Report, evaluating the operations and finances of the USPS. &#10; The Task Force Report stated that the USPS’s comprehensive delivery network that &#10; covers every address in the country is a critical part of the nation’s &#10; infrastructure and that maintaining this critical infrastructure as a national &#10; resource should be considered the primary business objective of the USPS. The &#10; Task Force Report further concluded that the USPS should make accommodating &#10; changes to its pricing, cost, and customer and revenue strategies. &#10;  &#10; In its Annual Report to Congress for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, &#10; the USPS reported that it owns nearly 8,400 and leases over 23,000 postal &#10; facilities. Approximately 11.2% of the leased properties are owned by the top &#10; ten private post office owners according to REAC, with the substantial majority &#10; of owners holding a single property. The USPS typically enters into five-year &#10; leases with postal lessors, including us, that are modified double-net leases &#10; pursuant to which the USPS, as tenant, is responsible for utilities and routine &#10; maintenance and reimburses the landlord for property taxes, while the landlord &#10; is responsible for insurance, roof and structure. &#10;  &#10; Our objective is to create stockholder value by generating attractive &#10; risk-adjusted returns through expanding our portfolio of owned and managed &#10; postal properties leased to the USPS. When assessing acquisitions, we look at &#10; properties that we believe are integral to USPS operations with a range of &#10; remaining lease terms. We also seek to acquire properties where we believe our &#10; property management expertise can enhance returns through reducing costs. In &#10; addition, we intend to expand our third-party property management, consulting &#10; and advisory services to enhance revenue and create potential future acquisition &#10; opportunities. We believe the fragmented ownership and specialized nature of &#10; properties leased to the USPS have limited the number and growth of professional &#10; property managers for these properties. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; Postal Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was incorporated in November &#10; 2018.

       "   'businessDescription': 'We are a leading U.S. provider of ultra-rugged mobile phones and accessories &#10; designed specifically for task workers physically engaged in their work &#10; environments, often in mission-critical roles. We currently sell our ruggedized &#10; mobile phones and accessories to three of the four largest wireless carriers in &#10; the United States—AT&T, Sprint and Verizon—as well as the three largest wireless &#10; carriers in Canada—Bell, Rogers and Telus Mobility. Our phones and accessories &#10; connect workers with voice, data and workflow applications in two end markets: &#10; industrial enterprise and public sector. &#10;  &#10; Task workers in these end markets have historically been limited to pen and &#10; paper and single-purpose electronic devices, such as barcode scanners, &#10; location-tracking devices and sensors, to accomplish specific daily tasks. These &#10; single-purpose devices have historically run on proprietary networks, such as &#10; land mobile radio, or LMR, networks, which enable push-to-talk, or PTT, services &#10; for voice communications. We provide Android-based devices that consolidate and &#10; integrate multiple functions into a single ruggedized solution running on &#10; commercial wireless networks at a total cost of ownership that we believe is &#10; significantly lower than comparable offerings with improved productivity and &#10; safety of task workers. &#10;  &#10; Our solutions fall into three main categories: (i) ultra-rugged mobile phones &#10; based on the Android platform that are capable of attaching to both public and &#10; private wireless networks, (ii) industrial-grade accessories and (iii)  &#10; cloud-based software and application services. End customers of our solutions  &#10; include construction, energy and utility, hospitality, logistics, manufacturing, &#10; public sector and transportation entities that primarily purchase our phones and &#10; accessories through their wireless carriers. All of our devices run on the  &#10; Android operating system, providing a familiar and intuitive user interface, and &#10; our smartphones have access to a library of millions of applications available  &#10; through the Google Play Store. We have also implemented dozens of application  &#10; programming interfaces, or APIs, specific to our mobile phones and have  &#10; partnered with over 800 application developers to create a purpose-built  &#10; experience for our end users using these applications on our mobile phones. &#10;  &#10; As of January 2019, we were the only privately held mobile phone provider to &#10; have a stocked product with three of the four largest U.S. wireless carriers: &#10; AT&T, Sprint and Verizon, meaning that these carriers test and certify our &#10; mobile phones on their networks and maintain inventory in their warehouses that &#10; they then sell through their enterprise and retail sales teams to end customers, &#10; often on a subsidized or financed basis. &#10;  &#10; We enter into master sales arrangements with the majority of our channel  &#10; partners (including channel partners contributing over 90% of our total revenues &#10; for the year ended December 31, 2018) under which our partners purchase our &#10; solutions for distribution on a purchase order basis. Under these arrangements, &#10; we and the channel partners determine sales channel distribution in connection &#10; with pricing (including any discounts and price protection) and positioning of &#10; each particular mobile device product. We also offer customer incentives in the &#10; form of funds used for channel marketing, as well as other limited promotional &#10; incentives, such as sales volume incentives, in exchange for retail price  &#10; reductions. We may also offer non-recurring engineering, or NRE, services in the &#10; form of third-party design services relating to the design of materials and  &#10; software licenses used in the manufacturing of our products. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We were incorporated in Delaware in August 1999 as NaviSpin.com, Inc.

       "   'useOfProceeds': 'We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of shares of common &#10; stock in this offering will be approximately $42.3 million, or approximately &#10; $48.9 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional &#10; shares of common stock in full, based upon an assumed initial public offering &#10; price of $14.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on &#10; the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts and &#10; commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive &#10; any of the proceeds from any sale of shares in this offering by the selling &#10; stockholder. &#10;  &#10; Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of &#10; $14.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the &#10; cover page of this prospectus, would increase or decrease, respectively, the &#10; amount of cash and cash equivalents, working capital, total assets and total &#10; stockholders’ equity by approximately $3.3 million, assuming the number of &#10; shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains &#10; the same and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and &#10; estimated offering expenses payable by us. Similarly, each increase or decrease &#10; of 1.0 million shares of our common stock offered by us would increase or &#10; decrease the amount of cash and cash equivalents, working capital, total assets &#10; and stockholders’ equity by approximately $13.0 million, assuming an initial &#10; public offering price of $14.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price &#10; range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting &#10; underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable &#10; by us. &#10;  &#10; The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to &#10; support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and &#10; thereby enable access to the public equity markets for our employees and &#10; stockholders and increase our visibility in the marketplace. We intend to use &#10; the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, including &#10; working capital, expanded sales and marketing activities, increased research and &#10; development expenditures and funding our growth strategies. We expect to use &#10; some of the net proceeds from this offering to satisfy anticipated tax &#10; withholding and remittance obligations related to the RSA Settlement in &#10; connection with this offering. Based on approximately 384,000 RSAs that are &#10; expected to be granted and to vest immediately prior to the closing of this &#10; offering, and based on the assumed initial public offering price of $14.00 per &#10; share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this &#10; prospectus), we estimate that these tax withholding obligations upon the RSA &#10; Settlement would be approximately $2.7 million in the aggregate. Each $1.00 &#10; increase or decrease in the price of our common stock at the time of the RSA &#10; Settlement from the assumed initial public offering price of $14.00 per share, &#10; assuming no change in the applicable tax rates, would increase or decrease, &#10; respectively, the amount we would expect to pay by approximately $192,000.  &#10;  &#10; We may use a portion of the net proceeds to prepay principal amounts outstanding &#10; and deferred accrued interest under the B. Riley Convertible Note (including a &#10; prepayment penalty of up to 2.0% of the outstanding principal amount prepaid, &#10; which fee is waived if the total outstanding principal amount following &#10; prepayment does not fall below $10.0 million). The B. Riley Convertible Note has &#10; an interest rate of 10.0% per year, matures on September 1, 2022, and had an &#10; outstanding principal balance, including deferred accrued interest, of $13.0  &#10; million as of December 31, 2018. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds  &#10; to acquire or invest in complimentary businesses, although we currently have no &#10; agreements or understandings with respect to any such acquisitions or  &#10; investments. Pending their application, we intend to invest the net proceeds in &#10; short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade investments, certificates of &#10; deposit or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.',\n",

These markets are highly  &#10; fragmented, evolving and increasingly competitive. Competition in our industry &#10; is intense and has been characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving &#10; industry standards, frequent new product introductions and rapid changes in end &#10; user requirements. &#10;  &#10; We face competition from manufacturers of non-rugged mobile phones such as Apple &#10; Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to the extent end users decide to &#10; purchase traditional devices for use in environments that we believe are better &#10; suited for ruggedized mobile phones. We also face competition from manufacturers &#10; of rugged mobile phones such as Bullitt Mobile Ltd. and Kyocera Corporation as &#10; well as from large system integrators and manufacturers of private and public &#10; wireless network equipment and devices. Competitors in this space include Harris &#10; Corporation, JVC KENWOOD Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc. and Tait &#10; International Limited. For the Data Capture and RFID portion of our product &#10; offerings, competitors include companies that provide a broad portfolio of &#10; barcode scanning products that are suitable for the majority of global market &#10; applications, such as Datalogic USA, Inc., Honeywell International Inc., &#10; Panasonic Corporation and Zebra Technologies Corporation. &#10;  &#10; We believe the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our  &#10; products are the products’ performance, features (including security features), &#10; quality, design innovation, reliability, price, customer service, reputation in &#10; the industry, brand loyalty and a strong third-party software and accessories &#10; ecosystem. We believe that our strongest competitive advantages are our &#10; products’ durability and reputation in the industry. In order to compete, we &#10; will be required to continue to respond promptly and effectively to the &#10; challenges of technological changes and our competitors’ innovations.',\n",

Our actual expenditures for some or all &#10;     of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, &#10;     we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current &#10;     estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial &#10;     business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business &#10;     combination. We do not anticipate any change in the categories of our &#10;     intended use of proceeds. &#10;  &#10; (6) In the event that the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the amount &#10;     available for “working capital, as necessary” and “working capital to cover &#10;     miscellaneous expenses” will be an aggregate of $1,205,000. &#10;  &#10; Certain of our stockholders have committed that they will purchase the private &#10; warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000) from us on a private &#10; placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. &#10;  &#10; $100,000,000, or $115,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, &#10; of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private warrants will be &#10; placed in a trust account in the United States at Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., &#10; maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The funds &#10; held in the trust account will be invested only in United States government &#10; treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in &#10; money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated &#10; under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. &#10; treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the &#10; Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held &#10; in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax &#10; obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the &#10; earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption &#10; of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business &#10; combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account &#10; may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which &#10; we complete our initial business combination to the extent not used to pay &#10; converting stockholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of &#10; the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business. &#10;  &#10; The payment to Health Sciences Holdings, LLC, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for &#10; general and administrative services including office space, utilities and &#10; secretarial support. However, pursuant to the terms of such agreement, we may &#10; delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination by our audit committee &#10; that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay actual or &#10; anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business combination. Any &#10; such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and payable no later &#10; than the date of the consummation of our initial business combination. This &#10; arrangement is being agreed to by Health Sciences Holdings, LLC for our benefit. &#10; We believe that the fee charged by Health Sciences Holdings, LLC is at least as &#10; favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This &#10; arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination &#10; or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than &#10; the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s fees, &#10; consulting fees or other similar compensation) will be paid to our insiders, &#10; members of our management team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for &#10; services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our &#10; initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). &#10; However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket &#10; expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as &#10; identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on &#10; suitable target businesses and business combinations, as well as traveling to &#10; and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target &#10; businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present management &#10; after our initial business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to &#10; determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our &#10; initial business combination. &#10;  &#10; The net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working &#10; capital requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be &#10; approximately $2,100,000 (or $1,800,000 if the over-allotment option is &#10; exercised in full). &#10;  &#10; The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account &#10; represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event &#10; that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such &#10; proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of &#10; undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is &#10; less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise &#10; additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently &#10; unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through &#10; loans or additional investments from our insiders, members of our management &#10; team or third parties, but our insiders, members of our management team or third &#10; parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. &#10;  &#10; We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, &#10; including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial &#10; business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the &#10; deferred underwriting commission payable to Chardan Capital Markets LLC in an &#10; amount equal to 3.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon &#10; consummation of our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital &#10; stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial &#10; business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used &#10; to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company &#10; and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working &#10; capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital &#10; funds could be used in a variety of ways, including continuing or expanding the &#10; target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, &#10; research and development of existing or new products. &#10;  &#10; To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay &#10; the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. &#10; If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds &#10; necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than &#10; $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. &#10;  &#10; In December 2018, Health Sciences Holdings, LLC loaned us $300,000 to be used to &#10; pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items &#10; above for the SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion &#10; of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and accounting fees and &#10; expenses. The loans are payable without interest upon the consummation of this &#10; offering. &#10;  &#10; We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient &#10; available funds to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our &#10; initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if &#10; necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation &#10; of this offering, our insiders may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, &#10; from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in &#10; their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The &#10; notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business &#10; combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $200,000 of &#10; the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into &#10; additional private warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant. Our stockholders &#10; have approved the issuance of the private warrants upon conversion of such &#10; notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of &#10; the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not complete a &#10; business combination, any loans and advances from our insiders or their &#10; affiliates, will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside our trust &#10; account, if any. &#10;  &#10; A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account &#10; only in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares &#10; if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period, (2) &#10; if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a &#10; stockholder vote or (3) if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any &#10; tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. In no other &#10; circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind &#10; to or in the trust account.',\n",
       "   'competition': 'In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter &#10; intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to &#10; ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience &#10; identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. &#10; Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources &#10; than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted &#10; with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous &#10; potential target businesses that we could complete a business combination with &#10; utilizing the net proceeds of this offering, our ability to compete in &#10; completing a business combination with certain sizable target businesses may be &#10; limited by our available financial resources. &#10;  &#10; The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses: &#10;  &#10; . our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial business &#10;   combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a &#10;   transaction; &#10;  &#10; . our obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public &#10;   stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business &#10;   combination; &#10;  &#10; . our outstanding warrants and the potential future dilution they represent; &#10;  &#10; . our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commission to Chardan Capital &#10;   Markets LLC upon consummation of our initial business combination; &#10;  &#10; . our obligation to either repay working capital loans that may be made to us by &#10;   our insiders or their affiliates; &#10;  &#10; . our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the &#10;   private warrants (and underlying securities) and any shares issued to our &#10;   insiders or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and &#10;  &#10; . the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities &#10;   under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us &#10;   prior to the consummation of a business combination. &#10;  &#10; Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully &#10; negotiating our initial business combination. Our management believes, however, &#10; that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States &#10; public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held &#10; entities having a similar business objective as ours in connection with an &#10; initial business combination with a target business with significant growth &#10; potential on favorable terms. &#10;  &#10; If we succeed in effecting our initial business combination, there will be, in &#10; all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. &#10; Subsequent to our initial business combination, we may not have the resources or &#10; ability to compete effectively.',\n",

       "   'useOfProceeds': 'We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of 6,153,846 shares &#10; of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $35.7 million, &#10; assuming an initial public offering price of $6.50 per share of common stock, &#10; which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this &#10; prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and &#10; estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their &#10; option to purchase additional shares in full, we estimate that the net proceeds &#10; from this offering will be approximately $41.3 million, after deducting &#10; estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses &#10; payable by us. &#10;  &#10; A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of &#10; $6.50 per share of common stock would increase or decrease the net proceeds from &#10; this offering by approximately $5.7 million, assuming that the number of shares &#10; offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the &#10; same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions. &#10; Similarly, each increase or decrease of $1.0 million in the amount of securities &#10; offered by us would increase or decrease the net proceeds that we receive from &#10; this offering by approximately $6.0 million, assuming the assumed initial public &#10; offering price remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting &#10; discounts and commissions. &#10;  &#10; We currently intend to use approximately $15.9 million of the net proceeds from &#10; this offering to satisfy the cash portion of the merger consideration payable to &#10; Inuvo stockholders. We also currently intend to use approximately $8.9 million &#10; for the reduction of indebtedness we incurred for working capital purposes under &#10; (i) the loan agreement with Western Alliance Bank (approximately $1.9 million), &#10; which does not have a maturity date and bears interest at a rate per annum equal &#10; to the prime rate plus 1%, (ii) the SellPoints unsecured subordinated promissory &#10; notes (approximately $3.1 million), which mature on May 31, 2019, and bear &#10; interest at the rate of 10% per annum, (iii) the Loan and Security Agreement &#10; with Montage Capital II, L.P and Partners for Growth IV, L.P. (approximately, &#10; $2.4 million), which matures upon the earlier of the closing of this offering &#10; and May 31, 2020, and bears interest at the rate of 12.25% per annum, (iv) notes &#10; payable to related parties of ConversionPoint (approximately $0.3 million), &#10; which accrue interest at a rate of 8% per annum and are due within 30 days after &#10; the date on which all amounts are repaid to Montage and Partners for Growth &#10; under the Loan and Security Agreement described above, (v) notes payable to &#10; related parties of Inuvo (approximately $0.3 million), which accrue interest at &#10; a rate of 10% per annum and mature on the earlier to occur of a change in &#10; control of Inuvo or November 2, 2019, and (vi) the promissory note issued to CPT &#10; Investments, LLC (approximately $1.0 million), which accrues interest at a rate &#10; of 10% per annum and is due and payable on June 30, 2019. We also intend to use &#10; approximately $10.9 million for general corporate purposes. The principal &#10; reasons for this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial &#10; flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a public &#10; market for our shares of common stock. &#10;  &#10; This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions &#10; based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of &#10; our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, &#10; including, among other things, the cash generated by our operations and the rate &#10; of growth, if any, of our business. As a result, our management will retain &#10; broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We &#10; may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering &#10; for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of net &#10; proceeds. &#10;  &#10; Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe &#10; that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash flow from &#10; operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. &#10;  &#10; Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the &#10; net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including &#10; short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments, certificates of &#10; deposit and direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. &#10;  &#10; ConversionPoint had negative operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, &#10; 2018. In the future, additional financing may be required to support our &#10; expected investments in our combined business. To the extent we, as a combined &#10; company, have negative cash flow in future periods, we may use a portion of our &#10; general working capital (including the proceeds of this offering) to fund such &#10; negative cash flow.',\n",
       "   'competition': 'The overall market for e-commerce solutions is rapidly evolving, highly &#10; competitive, complex, fragmented with numerous single point solutions, and is &#10; subject to changing technology and shifting customer needs. ConversionPoint &#10; faces significant competition. To maintain and improve ConversionPoint’s &#10; competitive position, ConversionPoint must keep pace with the evolving needs of &#10; its customers and continue to develop and introduce new modules, features and &#10; services in a timely and efficient manner, and complete the development of its &#10; unified end-to-end e-commerce SaaS platform. &#10;  &#10; ConversionPoint currently competes with established companies, such as &#10; Optimizely and Voluum in the digital media optimization space, WebCollage in the &#10; rich content creation and product information syndication space, Limelight and &#10; Click Funnels in the sales conversion space, AdRoll and Criteo in the &#10; remarketing space, and Narvar and ShipStation in the shipping and logistics &#10; space. &#10;  &#10; ConversionPoint believes the principal competitive factors in its market include &#10; the following: &#10;  &#10; · solution quality, breadth, flexibility and functionality; &#10;  &#10; · level of customer satisfaction and the ability to respond to customer needs   &#10;   rapidly;                                                                      &#10;  &#10; · ability to innovate and develop new or improved products and modules; and &#10;  &#10; · brand awareness and reputation. &#10;  &#10; ConversionPoint believes that it competes favorably with respect to the factors &#10; described above, however, competitors continue to increase their suite of &#10; offerings across e-commerce channels to better compete. A number of competitors &#10; have greater name recognition and are better capitalized than ConversionPoint. &#10; ConversionPoint’s ability to remain competitive in its market segment depends &#10; upon its ability to innovate and to efficiently provide unique solutions to its &#10; demand and supply customers.',\n",

As of the date hereof, there are 14 restaurant &#10; units operating under the Bricktown Brewery or Bricktown Tap House & Kitchen &#10; brand, each of which is in secondary and tertiary markets (based on population &#10; size) in its respective state. &#10;  &#10; The original Bricktown Brewery restaurant first opened in Oklahoma City, &#10; Oklahoma in 1992 “serving local beer and great food with truly friendly &#10; service.” Subsequently, we have expanded within Oklahoma and into Kansas, Texas &#10; and Arkansas, with additional licensed restaurants in Oklahoma and Missouri. We &#10; currently own and operate ten restaurants, including a restaurant to be acquired &#10; with the proceeds of this offering. We have licensed the right to open and &#10; operate three additional restaurants which we manage. These three licensed &#10; restaurants are owned by related parties and are not a part of the Company, &#10; although we expect to generate cash from these licensed properties in the future &#10; as described below. We also own 50% of a company that manages and operates &#10; various food and beverage outlets, including a licensed Bricktown Brewery &#10; restaurant at Remington Park, an Oklahoma City racetrack and casino. &#10;  &#10; We are actively looking to expand our business and the number of Company &#10; Restaurants both in the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Arkansas in which &#10; we operate and in the Southwest, Midwest, Southeast and Mid-South regions &#10; outside of our current footprint. We are also looking for complimentary &#10; restaurant brands that we may acquire to give us additional synergistic growth &#10; opportunity. &#10;                                       &#10; Each of the Bricktown Brewery and Bricktown Tap House & Kitchen branded &#10; restaurants serves similar fare. Our menu features crafted burgers, artisanal &#10; style pizza and Bricktwisted® Comfort Food, our take on American comfort foods. &#10; The prices of our food items range from $3.50 to $16.00 per item which we &#10; believe makes our restaurants appealing to a variety of different guests and for &#10; various dining occasions (including everyday lunch and dinner as well as after &#10; work special occasions). Additionally, each of our Bricktown Brewery locations &#10; serve our own hand-crafted beers as well as a full line up of regional beers &#10; that we sell as “local beer.” We brew a variety of trademarked beers as well as &#10; non-alcoholic craft root beer at our original Bricktown Brewery location in &#10; downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and at our satellite brewing facility, BTB &#10; Brewing Company, which is also in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Because of Texas &#10; state laws, each of our Bricktown Tap House & Kitchen locations feature regional &#10; local beer but do not sell our brewed beers. All restaurants serve a full &#10; complement of distilled spirts, beers and wine. Across the Company Restaurants &#10; in 2018, we had an average customer transaction of $18.10 with a sales ratio of &#10; 76% food and non-alcoholic beverages to 24% alcoholic beverages (of which &#10; Bricktown Brewery beers accounted for approximately one-third of the sales). &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We were organized originally as a limited liability company under the laws of &#10; the State of Oklahoma in October, 2014 and will convert to a corporation &#10; immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which &#10; this prospectus forms a part.

       "   'useOfProceeds': 'We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock we &#10; are offering will be approximately $13.2 million based on an assumed offering &#10; price of $8.00 per share (which represents the mid-point of the estimated range &#10; of the initial public offering price shown on the front cover of this &#10; prospectus). If the underwriters fully exercise the over-allotment option, the &#10; net proceeds of the shares we sell will be approximately $15.2 million. “Net &#10; proceeds” is what we expect to receive after deducting the underwriting discount &#10; and commission and estimated offering expenses payable by us. &#10;  &#10; Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed offering price of $8.00 would &#10; increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately &#10; $1.810 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discount and commission &#10; and estimated offering expenses payable by us, assuming that the number of &#10; shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains &#10; the same. Each increase of 100,000 shares in the number of shares offered by us &#10; at the assumed public offering price would increase the net proceeds to us in &#10; this offering by approximately $730,000. Similarly, each decrease of 100,000 &#10; shares in the number of shares offered by us at the assumed public offering &#10; price would decrease the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately &#10; $730,000. A change in the offering price or the number of shares by these &#10; amounts could have a material effect on our uses of the proceeds from this &#10; offering, and it may impact the amount of time prior to which we will need to &#10; seek additional capital. &#10;  &#10; We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to acquire 71st &#10; Street (as described in more detail elsewhere in this prospectus), repay related &#10; party notes, repay a promissory note held by a non-affiliated individual (such &#10; promissory note matures on December 31, 2019 and bears interest at a rate of 10% &#10; per annum), invest in or acquire companies that are synergistic with or  &#10; complimentary to our business (including, potentially, our licensed restaurants &#10; – though we have no contractual right to acquire these restaurants and there has &#10; not been any negotiation pertaining to the acquisition of such restaurants) and &#10; for working capital and other general corporate purposes. &#10;  &#10; We anticipate an approximate allocation of the use of net proceeds as follows: &#10;  &#10;                                                                $           &#10; Use of Net Proceeds                                      (in millions)*        % &#10; Acquisition of 71st Street                                          .85              6 &#10; Repayment of Related Party Indebtedness                            2.09             16 &#10; Repayment of Promissory Note                                        .15              1 &#10; Acquisition of Synergistic Companies, Working Capital                      &#10; and General                                                                &#10; Corporate Purposes                                                10.11             77 &#10; Total                                                              13.2            100 &#10;  &#10; * Assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised. &#10;  &#10; While we expect to use the net proceeds for the purposes described above, the &#10; amounts and timing of our actual expenditures, other than the acquisition of &#10; 71st Street, will depend upon numerous factors, including the aggregate amount &#10; raised in this offering. The expected net proceeds from the sale of the shares &#10; offered hereby, if added to our current cash and cash equivalents is anticipated &#10; to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. In the &#10; event that our plans change, our assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate, &#10; or the net proceeds of this offering are less than as set forth herein or &#10; otherwise prove to be insufficient, it may be necessary or advisable to &#10; reallocate proceeds or curtail expansion activities, or we may be required to &#10; seek additional financing or curtail our operations. As a result of the &#10; foregoing, our success will be affected by our discretion and judgment with &#10; respect to the application and allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. &#10;  &#10; Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in &#10; short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade &#10; instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the &#10; U.S. government.',\n",
       "   'competition': 'The restaurant industry, including the casual dining subset segment is highly &#10; competitive. Bricktown Brewery and Bricktown Tap House & Kitchen compete with a &#10; large number of other varied menu restaurants in the areas in which we operate. &#10; We face significant competition from restaurants in the full service casual &#10; dining, brewpub, and fast casual dining segments of the restaurant industry. &#10; These segments are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, &#10; taste, price, food quality and presentation, beer selection, brewed beers &#10; service, location, and the ambience and condition of each restaurant. Our &#10; competition includes a variety of locally-owned restaurants and national and &#10; regional chains offering dine-in, carry-out, delivery, and catering services. &#10; Among our competitors are a number of multi-unit, multi-market, casual dining &#10; and brewpub restaurant concepts, some of which are expanding nationally. As we &#10; expand, we will face competition from these restaurant concepts as well as new &#10; competitors that strive to compete with our market segments. These competitors &#10; may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better &#10; facilities, better management, more effective marketing, and more efficient &#10; operations. Many of the restaurants with which Bricktown Brewery and Bricktown &#10; Tap House & Kitchen compete are owned and operated by regional and national &#10; chains, many of which have greater resources and experiences than we do. &#10; Restaurant companies that currently compete with Bricktown in our markets &#10; include Chili’s, Applebee’s, TGIF, Buffalo Wild Wings and other regional, &#10; national and local restaurant groups. Among younger customers, we also face &#10; competition from “meal-kit” companies such as Blue Apron or Hello Fresh, that &#10; sell “prepare at home” meals. &#10;  &#10; We believe that Bricktown Brewery and Bricktown Tap House & Kitchen has an &#10; advantage in our proprietary beers, hand crafted quality of our food and the &#10; unusual mix of food items, quality, quantity and price.',\n",

We estimate that &#10; our net proceeds will be approximately $       million if the underwriters &#10; exercise in full their over-allotment option. &#10;  &#10; The underwriters will not be entitled to receive any payment from us at closing. &#10; PIMCO, as our manager, will pay to the underwriters, on our behalf, $       per &#10; share (or     % of the public offering price) for shares sold in this offering &#10; at closing, of which, $       per share (or        % of the public offering &#10; price) will be paid at closing and, only if our gross proceeds from this &#10; offering and future offerings of our common stock and preferred stock equals or &#10; exceeds $       billion, or the Deferral Condition, $       per share (or &#10;       % of the public offering price) will be paid on a deferred basis.

We believe that the &#10; depth and liquidity of the Agency RMBS market, including the TBA market, will &#10; allow us to deploy a significant portion of the net proceeds of this offering in &#10; a relatively short period of time. In particular, upon completion of this &#10; offering, we expect to purchase a significant amount of TBAs in the near term to &#10; accelerate the construction of our initial portfolio, often taking physical &#10; delivery of the underlying Agency RMBS and settling our obligations for cash &#10; provided from this offering and/or with borrowings under repurchase agreements. &#10; However, we may also utilize TBA dollar roll transactions as a means of &#10; investing in and financing Agency RMBS. Although we expect to purchase a &#10; significant amount of TBAs in the near term, we expect to reduce the percentage &#10; of our portfolio that consists of TBAs over time consistent with our intention &#10; to qualify for taxation as a REIT and maintain our exclusion from registration &#10; under the 1940 Act. &#10;  &#10; We expect to use the balance of the proceeds from this offering to acquire other &#10; assets in accordance with our objectives and strategies described in this &#10; prospectus. However, until appropriate assets can be identified for the &#10; proceeds, we may also invest the proceeds from this offering in interest-bearing &#10; or dividend paying short-term investments and/or investment funds that may &#10; invest in similar investments (which subject to the conflicts of interest policy &#10; described below may include funds managed by PIMCO or its affiliates, provided &#10; that any additional fees payable to PIMCO attributable to our equity investment &#10; in such funds are credited against any base management fee payable by us or &#10; otherwise rebated to us), including money market accounts, that are consistent &#10; with our intention to qualify for taxation as a REIT and maintain our exclusion &#10; from registration under the 1940 Act. These interest-bearing short-term &#10; investments are expected to provide a lower net return than we will seek to &#10; achieve from our Target Assets. Additionally, upon the closing of this offering, &#10; we will use $10,000 of the net proceeds to repurchase the 1,000 shares of common &#10; stock held by PIMCO for $10.00 per share, which is the price at which PIMCO &#10; purchased the shares from us.',\n",
       "   'competition': 'Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire our Target &#10; Assets at attractive prices. We are subject to significant competition in &#10; acquiring our Target Assets. In particular, we will compete with a variety of &#10; institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, &#10; public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, mortgage &#10; bankers, commercial finance and insurance companies, governmental bodies and &#10; other financial institutions. We may also compete with PIMCO and its affiliates &#10; for investment opportunities. In addition, there are several REITs with similar &#10; investment objectives and others may be organized in the future. These other &#10; REITs will increase competition for the available supply of residential mortgage &#10; and other real estate-related assets suitable for purchase or origination. Some &#10; of our anticipated competitors have greater financial resources, access to lower &#10; costs of capital and access to funding sources that may not be available to us, &#10; such as funding from the U.S. government, if we are not eligible to participate &#10; in programs established by the U.S. government. In addition, some of our &#10; competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT &#10; tax compliance or maintenance of an exclusion or exemption from the 1940 Act. &#10; Furthermore, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or &#10; different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety &#10; of investments, or pay higher prices, than we can. Current market conditions may &#10; attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for our Target &#10; Assets. An increase in the competition for such assets may increase the price of &#10; such assets, which may limit our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted &#10; returns for our stockholders, thereby adversely affecting the market price of &#10; our common stock. &#10;  &#10; In the face of this competition, we expect to have access to PIMCO’s &#10; professionals and their industry experience, which we believe will provide us &#10; with a competitive advantage and help us assess investment risks and determine &#10; appropriate pricing for potential investments. We expect that these &#10; relationships will enable us to compete more efficiently and effectively for &#10; attractive investment opportunities. In addition, we believe that current market &#10; conditions may have adversely affected the financial condition of certain &#10; competitors. Thus, not having a legacy portfolio may also enable us to compete &#10; more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Although we believe we &#10; are well positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there &#10; can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business goals or &#10; expectations due to the extensive competition in our market sector. We operate &#10; in a competitive market for investment opportunities and future competition may &#10; limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our Target Assets and &#10; could also affect the pricing of these securities.',\n",

In 2010, Avantor was acquired by affiliates of New Mountain Capital, &#10; LLC (\"New Mountain Capital\"), our sponsor, from Covidien plc. Since then, we &#10; have expanded through a series of large acquisitions across the globe. In 2016, &#10; we acquired NuSil, a leading supplier of high-purity silicone products for the &#10; medical device industry that was founded in 1985. In 2017, we also acquired VWR, &#10; a global manufacturer and distributor of laboratory and production products and &#10; services founded in 1852 that now represents the primary ordering platform for &#10; our customers.

The selling stockholder &#10; will receive approximately $1,900.00 of proceeds from this offering. &#10;  &#10; We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the concurrent offering of the &#10; Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, if completed, will be approximately &#10; $481.0 million (or approximately $553.4 million if the underwriters of that &#10; offering exercise their over-allotment option to purchase additional shares of &#10; the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in full), in each case after deducting &#10; estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses &#10; payable by us. &#10;  &#10; We intend to use approximately $2,629.1 million (including the accumulated and &#10; unpaid dividends and make whole amount) of the net proceeds to us from both &#10; offerings to redeem all outstanding shares of our Existing Senior Preferred &#10; Stock, with any remaining proceeds used to repay $471.2 million and &#10; $269.7 million of outstanding indebtedness under the Dollar Term Loan Facility &#10; and the Euro Term Loan Facility, respectively. The Term Loan Facility matures in &#10; November 2024. The Dollar Term Loan Facility bears interest on the outstanding &#10; unpaid principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at Avantor &#10; Funding’s option, either (a) a base rate or (b) a LIBOR rate, in each case &#10; subject to interest rate floors. The Euro Term Loan Facility bears interest on &#10; the outstanding unpaid principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable margin &#10; plus the EURIBO Rate, subject to an interest rate floor. The applicable margin &#10; for the term loans under the Dollar Term Loan Facility, after giving effect to &#10; the Repricing Amendment, is 3.75%, with respect to LIBOR borrowings, and 2.75%, &#10; with respect to base rate borrowings. The applicable margin under the Euro Term &#10; Loan Facility is 3.75%.  &#10;  &#10; A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of &#10; $19.50 per share, based on the midpoint of the estimated offering price range &#10; shown on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) the net &#10; proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $148.6 million, assuming the &#10; number of shares offered by us, shown on the cover page of this prospectus, &#10; remains the same and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and &#10; commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us for this offering. An &#10; increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares from the expected number of shares to be &#10; sold by us in this offering, assuming no change in the assumed initial public &#10; offering price per share, the midpoint of the estimated offering price range &#10; shown on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) our net &#10; proceeds from this offering by $18.8 million. To the extent we raise more &#10; proceeds in this offering than currently estimated, we will repay additional &#10; amounts under the Term Loan Facility. To the extent we raise less proceeds in &#10; this offering than currently estimated, we will reduce the amount we repay under &#10; the Term Loan Facility. &#10;  &#10; Certain affiliates of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, an underwriter in this offering, &#10; will receive an aggregate of approximately $421 million following this offering &#10; as a result of currently holding 372,872 shares of our Existing Senior Preferred &#10; Stock and being a lender under the Dollar Term Loan Facility and the Euro Term &#10; Loan Facility, which represents 12.5% of the net proceeds from this offering and &#10; the concurrent offering (or 10.9% of the net proceeds of this offering and the &#10; concurrent offering if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment options in &#10; full in both offerings). &#10;  &#10; To the extent that the underwriters in this offering exercise all or a portion &#10; of their over-allotment option to purchase additional shares of our common stock &#10; or the underwriters in the concurrent offering of Mandatory Convertible &#10; Preferred Stock exercise all or a portion of their over-allotment option to &#10; purchase additional shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, the net &#10; proceeds received will be used to repay indebtedness pro rata under the Term &#10; Loan Facility.',\n",

       "   'companyDescription': 'Developers are reinventing the way we live, work, and play online. Yet they &#10; repeatedly encounter innovation barriers when delivering modern digital &#10; experiences. Expectations for digital experiences are at an all-time high; they &#10; must be fast, secure, and highly personalized. If they aren’t reliable, &#10; end-users simply take their business elsewhere. The challenge today is enabling &#10; developers to deliver a modern digital experience while simultaneously providing &#10; scale, security, and performance. We built our edge cloud platform to solve this &#10; problem. &#10;  &#10; The edge cloud is a new category of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) that &#10; enables developers to build, secure, and deliver digital experiences at the edge &#10; of the internet. This service represents the convergence of the Content Delivery &#10; Network (CDN) with functionality that has been traditionally delivered by &#10; hardware-centric appliances such as Application Delivery Controllers (ADC), Web &#10; Application Firewalls (WAF), Bot Detection, and Distributed Denial of Service &#10; (DDoS) solutions. It also includes the emergence of a new, but growing edge &#10; computing market which aims to move compute power and logic as close to the &#10; end-user as possible. The edge cloud uses the emerging cloud computing, &#10; serverless paradigm in which the cloud provider runs the server and dynamically &#10; manages the allocation of machine resources. When milliseconds matter, &#10; processing at the edge is an ideal way to handle highly dynamic and &#10; time-sensitive data. The edge cloud complements data center, central cloud, and &#10; hybrid solutions. &#10;  &#10; Our mission is to fuel the next modern digital experience by providing &#10; developers with a programmable and reliable edge cloud platform that they adopt &#10; as their own. &#10;  &#10; Organizations must keep up with complex and ever-evolving end-user requirements. &#10; We help them surpass their end-users’ expectations by powering fast, secure, and &#10; scalable digital experiences. We built a powerful edge cloud platform, designed &#10; from the ground up to be programmable and support agile software development. We &#10; believe our platform gives our customers a significant competitive advantage, &#10; whether they were born into the digital age or are just embarking on their &#10; digital transformation journey. Our platform consists of three key components: a &#10; programmable edge, a software-defined modern network, and a philosophy of &#10; customer empowerment. Our programmable edge provides developers with real-time &#10; visibility and control where they can write and deploy code to push application &#10; logic to the edge. It supports modern application delivery processes, freeing &#10; developers to innovate without constraints. Our software-defined modern network &#10; is built for the software-defined future. It is powerful, efficient, and &#10; flexible, designed to enable us to rapidly scale to meet the needs of the most &#10; demanding customers and never be a barrier to their growth. Our 45 terabit edge &#10; network is located in 60 uniquely designed points-of-presence (POPs) across the &#10; world as of March 31, 2019. Finally, being developers ourselves, we empower &#10; customers to build great things while supporting their efforts through &#10; frictionless tools and a deeply technical support team that facilitates ongoing &#10; collaboration. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We were initially incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in March &#10; 2011 under the name SkyCache, Inc.

Our &#10; customers represent a diverse set of organizations across many industries with &#10; one thing in common: they are competing by using the power of software to build &#10; differentiation at the edge. With our edge cloud platform, our customers are &#10; disrupting existing industries and creating new ones. For example, several of &#10; our customers have reinvented digital publishing by connecting readers through &#10; subscription models to indispensable content, helping people understand the &#10; world through deeply reported independent journalism. Our customers’ software &#10; applications use our edge cloud platform to ensure concert goers can buy tickets &#10; to the live events they love, travelers can book flights seamlessly and embark &#10; on their next great adventure, and sports fans can stream events in real time, &#10; across all devices. The range of applications that developers build with our &#10; edge cloud platform continues to surpass our expectations. &#10;  &#10; So where do we go from here? Our vision is to create a trustworthy internet, &#10; where good thrives. We want all developers to have the ability to deliver the &#10; next transformative digital experience on a global scale. And because big ideas &#10; often start small, we love it when developers experiment and iterate on our edge &#10; cloud platform, coming up with exciting new ways to solve today’s complex &#10; problems. &#10;  &#10; Our usage-based revenue grows as our customers’ websites and applications &#10; deliver, process, and protect more traffic, as they adopt more features of our &#10; edge platform and as they more broadly adopt our platform across their &#10; organizations. A meaningful indicator of the increased activity from our &#10; existing customers is our Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate (DBNER), which was &#10; 147.3%, 132.0%, 140.3%, and 130.4% for the years ended December 31, 2017, &#10; December 31, 2018, and the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, &#10; respectively. &#10; --- &#10;  &#10; We were initially incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in March &#10; 2011 under the name SkyCache, Inc.

       "   'useOfProceeds': 'We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of shares of our &#10; Class A common stock in this offering will be approximately $150.9 million, or &#10; approximately $174.5 million if the underwriters exercise their option to &#10; purchase additional shares in full, based upon an assumed initial public &#10; offering price of $15.00 per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on &#10; the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting underwriting discounts and &#10; commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. &#10;  &#10; Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of &#10; $15.00 per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of &#10; this prospectus, would increase or decrease the net proceeds to us from this &#10; offering by approximately $10.5 million, assuming that the number of shares &#10; offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the &#10; same, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated &#10; offering expenses payable by us. We may also increase or decrease the number of &#10; shares we are offering. A 1,000,000 share increase or decrease in the number of &#10; shares offered by us would increase or decrease the net proceeds to us from this &#10; offering by approximately $14.0 million, assuming that the assumed initial &#10; offering price to the public remains the same, and after deducting underwriting &#10; discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We do &#10; not expect that a change in the initial offering price to the public or the &#10; number of shares by these amounts would have a material effect on uses of the &#10; proceeds from this offering, although it may accelerate the time at which we &#10; will need to seek additional capital. &#10;  &#10; The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial &#10; flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock, and facilitate &#10; our future access to the capital markets. Although we have not yet determined &#10; with certainty the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds of this &#10; offering, we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for working &#10; capital and other general corporate purposes. We may use a portion of the net &#10; proceeds we receive from this offering to repay up to approximately $47.5 &#10; million of indebtedness under our credit facilities, which, to date, has been &#10; used for general operating expenses, including personnel related costs as we &#10; expanded our employee base, and capital expenditures for our network. We may &#10; also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for acquisitions or &#10; strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies. We do not &#10; currently have any plans for any such acquisitions or investments. We have not &#10; allocated specific amounts of net proceeds for any of these purposes. &#10;  &#10; $27.5 million of the outstanding indebtedness that we may repay under our credit &#10; facilities is scheduled to mature in November 2021 and interest on such amount &#10; accrues at a rate of prime plus 1.75%. $20.0 million of the outstanding &#10; indebtedness that we may repay under our credit facilities is scheduled to &#10; mature in December 2021 and interest on such amount accrues at a rate of prime &#10; plus 4.25%. &#10;  &#10; The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions &#10; based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with &#10; certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the &#10; amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly, &#10; our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of &#10; this offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on &#10; many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of &#10; our business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this &#10; offering in a variety of capital-preservation investments, including short- and &#10; intermediate-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.',\n",
       "   'competition': 'Our platform spans several markets from cloud computing and cloud security to &#10; CDNs. We segment the competitive landscape into four key categories: &#10;  &#10; • Legacy CDNs like Akamai, Limelight, EdgeCast (part of Verizon Digital Media), &#10;   Level3, and Imperva (for security); &#10;  &#10; • Small business focused CDNs like InStart, Cloudflare, StackPath, and &#10;   Section.io; &#10;  &#10; • Cloud providers who are starting to offer compute functionality at the edge &#10;   like Amazon’s CloudFront, AWS Lambda, and Google Cloud Platform; and &#10;  &#10; • Traditional data center and appliance vendors like F5, Citrix, A10 Networks, &#10;   Cisco, Imperva, Radware, and Arbor, as well as networks that offer a range of &#10;   on-premise solutions for load balancing, WAF, and DDoS. &#10;  &#10; The principle competitive factors in our market include: &#10;  &#10; • Platform scalability and performance; &#10;  &#10; • Global network coverage; &#10;  &#10; • Platform reliability and security; &#10;  &#10; • Ease of integration and programmability; &#10;  &#10; • Credibility with developers; &#10;  &#10; • Ability to support modern application development processes; &#10;  &#10; • Brand awareness, reputation, and trust; &#10;  &#10; • Strength of our sales and marketing efforts; &#10;  &#10; • Quality of customer support; and &#10;  &#10; • Price and network cost savings. &#10;  &#10; We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of &#10; these factors. Our edge cloud platform integrates many of the point products &#10; offered by our competitors which is a key differentiator.

With our centralized technology &#10; system, we are able to simplify and standardize our operations, which allows us &#10; to improve operational efficiency and quickly expand and scale up our business. &#10; We leverage big data analytics and AI to analyze our customer behavior and &#10; transaction data, which enables us to continuously enhance our products and &#10; services, implement dynamic pricing and improve customer retention. We also &#10; leverage our proprietary technologies in store operations and supply chain to &#10; support our business, such as new store selection, inventory management and &#10; workforce management. Our focus on technologies has enabled us to operate &#10; efficiently, grow rapidly while maintaining quality control. &#10; --- &#10;   &#10; We offer premium coffee and other high-quality products to our customers. We &#10; source premium Arabica coffee beans from prominent suppliers and engage World &#10; Barista Champion teams to design our coffee recipes. We procure coffee machines &#10; and coffee condiments from renowned global suppliers such as Schaerer. Our &#10; coffee has won numerous awards, including most recently the Gold Medal in the &#10; 2018 IIAC International Coffee Tasting competition. We also partner with &#10; reputable suppliers for our other products such as juices and light meals. Due &#10; to our scale, we are able to procure high-quality products from our suppliers at &#10; favorable prices. &#10;  &#10; Since inception, we have successfully built a brand of distinguished value &#10; propositions—high quality, high affordability and high convenience. We have also &#10; been able to cultivate a large and loyal customer base and achieve strong &#10; growth. Within 18 months, we expanded from a single trial store in Beijing to &#10; 2,370 stores in 28 cities in China as of March 31, 2019. We had over 16.8 &#10; million of cumulative transacting customers as of March 31, 2019. In addition, &#10; our customer repurchase rate in 2018 was over 54%. &#10;  &#10; China's coffee market is highly underpenetrated. Inconsistent qualities, high &#10; prices and inconvenience have hampered the growth of the freshly brewed coffee &#10; market in China.

In utilizing the &#10; proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement to Louis &#10; Dreyfus Company B.V., we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide &#10; funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions, and &#10; to our consolidated VIE only through loans, and only if we satisfy the &#10; applicable government registration and approval requirements.

We currently see no material obstacles in completing the &#10; registration and approval procedures with respect to future capital &#10; contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. &#10;  &#10; Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in &#10; short-term, interest-bearing, financial instruments or demand deposits.',\n",

However, our competitors may have longer operating &#10; history, greater brand recognition, more capital, better supplier relationships &#10; and larger customer base.\",\n",
